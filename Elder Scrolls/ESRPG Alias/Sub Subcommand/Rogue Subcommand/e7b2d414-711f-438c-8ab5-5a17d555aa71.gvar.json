If you are already proficient with the disguise kit, choose a different tool from those listed in the rogue's proficiencies.\n\nAdditionally, you can unerringly mimic the speech patterns and accent of a creature that you hear speak for at least 1 minute, allowing you to pass yourself off as a native speaker of a particular land, provided that you know the language.\n\n**Ambush**\n*3rd-level Agent feature*\nAt 3rd level, your Precise Attacks are more effective. When you use a Precise Attack, you roll 1 additional Precision Die of the same dice type.\n\nWhen you reach 9th level in this class, you roll 2 additional Precision dice, and you roll 3 additional Precision dice at 15th level.\n\n**Infiltration Expert**\n*9th-level Agent feature*\nStarting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend seven days and 100 septims to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants.\n\nOther characters believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to.\n\n**Imposter**\n*13th-level Agent feature*\nAt 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing and behavior. You must spend at least 3 hours studying these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.\n\nYour ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Personality (Deception) check you make to avoid detection.\n\n**Eternal Deceit**\n*17th-level Agent feature*\nStarting at 17th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means, unless you allow it.

Choose a friendly creature that is within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you. That creature can make a melee or ranged attack with its reaction.",

Your poison options are detailed at the end of the Assassin's description. You learn one additional assassin's poison of your choice at 9th level, and again at 13th, and 17th level.\n\n*Poisons.* Once each day, when you spend 1 hour gathering materials and creating poison, you create a series of vials with the various assassin's poisons you know. You can use any combination of these poisons an amount of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.\n\nOn your turn, you can use a bonus action to apply the poison to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, trap components, or other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage. The object remains potent for the next minute, until the poison is delivered through a wound, a new poison is applied, or the poison is washed off. The potency of all unused poisons is lost after 24 hours.\n\n*Saving Throws.* Your poisons require your target to make an Endurance saving throw to resist the poisons effects. On a failed save, the target is effected by the poison as noted in its description. On a successful save, the target takes half the amount of damage and suffers no other effects. An affected creature can make another saving throw at the start of each of their turns. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\nAssassin's Poison save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\n\n*follow https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Assassin for a list of available Poisons.*\n\n**Nimble Attacks**\n*9th-level Assassin feature*\nStarting at 9th level, whenever you roll initiative, roll an additional 1d8 and add the result to the total.\n\n**Assassinate**\n*13th-level Assassin feature*\nStarting at 13th level, you are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies.

As a bonus action, you can make a Willpower (Insight) check against a creature you can see that isn’t incapacitated, contested by the target’s Personality (Deception) check. If you succeed, when you use Precision Dice to attack a creature, you roll twice the normal amount of Precision Dice, taking the highest rolls, as though you had advantage.

As an action, you sense the presence of illusions, shapechangers not in their original form, and other magic designed to deceive the senses within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't blinded or deafened. You sense that an effect is attempting to trick you, but gain no insight into what is hidden or its true nature.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n**Eye for Weakness**\n*17th-level Inquisitor feature*\nAt 17th level, you learn to exploit a creature’s weaknesses by carefully studying its tactics and movement.

This die increases in size at 6th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th (1d12).\n\nYour affiliation with the Dread Lord allows you to use a bonus action to imbue a target with the power of Sithis, marking them for death. This mark gives you alone power over your foe.\n- While marked, once on each of your turns, when you miss an attack against the target, it takes necrotic damage equal to the number you roll on your sithis die.\n- All your attacks of opportunity against that target have advantage.\n- When you reduce the target to 0 hit points you gain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).\n- The marked target has disadvantage on all saving throws prompted by you.\n\nThis benefit lasts until you finish a short rest. When the marked creature is reduced to 0 hp you can use a bonus action to mark a new creature hostile to you.

On a failed save, the creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces one or more Small or larger hostile creatures to 0 hit points, you can make one additional weapon attack as part of the Attack action on your next turn.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.",

As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you’re wielding, provided that you move no more than 5 feet on your turn. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:\n- You give yourself advantage on your next attack made with a ranged weapon on this turn.\n- The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.\n\n**Trick Shot**\n*3rd-level Archer feature*\nYou focus hard and aim to disable your foe. Once per turn, when you hit a target with a ranged weapon attack, you can force it to make a Strength saving throw (the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Agility attribute modifier). On a failed save, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:\n- The target falls prone if it is a Medium or smaller sized creature\n- The target’s speed is reduced by half until the start of your next turn\n- The target is pushed back 10 feet away from you if it is a Large or smaller sized creature\n- The target makes Strength saving throws with disadvantage until the start of your next turn\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n**Iron Mind**\n*7th-level Archer feature*\nYour time studying beasts and the focus required by archery has stilled your mind. You gain proficiency in Willpower saving throws and have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\n\n**Archer's Mastery**\n*11th-level Archer feature*\nYou gain one of the following features of your choice:\n\n*Critical Shot.* Your ranged weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.\n*Flurry.* Once on each of your turns, if you miss with a ranged weapon attack during your turn, you can immediately make an additional attack with the same weapon.\n*Scatter Shot.* When another creature damages you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to move up to half your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the creature. You can then make a weapon attack against that same creature as part of this reaction.\n\n**Rapid Strike**\n*15th-level Archer feature*\nYou learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forego that advantage to make an additional weapon attack against the same target. You can only make this extra attack once on each of your turns.",

It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.\n- When you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command the beast to take the Attack action, instead of using a bonus action.\n- When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your daedric beast companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.\n- Your daedric beast companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature.

Once per long rest, you are able to transform into a were-creature of your choice for 1 hour. You normally choose your form from the following lycanthropes: a werebat, a werebear, a wereboar, a werecrocodile, a werelion, a wererat, a wereraven, a wereshark, a weretiger, a werevulture, or a werewolf. However, your GM might pick one of these animals for you, or an animal based on a creature appropriate for the campaign setting. You can find the statistics for these creatures in the Blessings and Curses and the Shadows Over Skyrim supplements, or in the 5e Core Rules.\n*follow https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Hunter#Hircine.27s_Gift for details*",

When you roll initiative, you gain a special turn that takes place before other creatures can act. On this turn, you can use your action to take either the Attack or Hide action. If more than one creature in an encounter has this feature, they all act first in order of initiative, then the regular initiative order begins.\n\nIf you would normally be surprised at the start of an encounter, you are not surprised but you do not gain this extra turn.\n\n**Multiattack**\n*11th-level Scout feature*\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice:\n\n*Barrage.* You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within a 20-foot cone originating from you.

Each subsequent attack that hits the target after the first increases your critical score range by one. At the end of your turn, this feature ends and reverts your critical hit range back to normal.\n\nFor example, hitting a target on your turn will allow the next attack on that same turn against that same target to score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. Hitting the same target a second time will increase this critical hit range to 18–20, and so forth.",

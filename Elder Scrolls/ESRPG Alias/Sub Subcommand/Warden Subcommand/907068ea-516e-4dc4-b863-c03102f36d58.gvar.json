With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 200 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion from any beast with a CR of ½ or lower, such as an ape, a black bear, a boar, a giant badger, a giant weasel, a mule, a panther, or a wolf. However, your GM might pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would be logically present in the area.\n\nAt the end of 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.\n\nIf your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 septims worth of rare herbs and fine food you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.\n\nIf you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.\nIf you gain a new animal companion at higher levels, you can choose from any beast with a CR as shown on the Beast Companions At Higher Levels table.\n*follow https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Conclave_of_Companions#Beast_Companion for more details on Beast Companion*\n\n**Speech of the Woods**\n*2nd-Level Conclave of Companions feature*\nYou gain the ability to converse with beasts. Beasts can understand your speech, and you gain the ability to decipher their noises and motions. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn't grant you friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.\n\n**Companion's Mark**\n*6th-Level Conclave of Companions feature*\nWhen any creature is marked by your Mark of Balance, your companion is also marked as an Ally.\n\nIn addition, when your companion attacks a creature marked as an Enemy, it deals additional damage equal to your Willpower modifier.\n\n**Spirit Companion**\n*10th-Level Conclave of Companions feature*\nYou call forth nature spirits to influence the world around you. As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. It counts as neither a creature or a an object, though it has the spectral appearance of a creature it represents.\n\nYour spirit companion acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A spirit companion can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.\n\nWhile the spirit is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through the spirit's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the spirit has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\n\nThe spirit persists for 1 minute or until you're incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nThe effects of the spirit companion depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.\n*follow https://wiki.uestrpg.com/wiki/BR:Conclave_of_Companions#Spirit_Companion for more details on Spirit forms.*\n\n**Shared Spells**\n*14th-Level Conclave of Companions feature*\nWhen you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.",

At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed or a swimming speed.\nWild Shapes\n```\nWarden Level| Max CR| Limitations\n------------------------------\n2nd         | 1     | No flying or swimming speed\n4th         | 1     | No flying speed\n6th         | 2     | No flying speed\n8th         | 2     | --\n9th         | 3     | --\n12th        | 4     | --\n15th        | 5     | --\n18th        | 6     | --\n```\nYou can stay in a wild shape for a number of hours equal to half your warden level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Willpower, and Personality scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has an legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your breast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.\n- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave that form.\n\n**Primal Strike**\n*6th-Level Conclave of the Wild feature*\nStarting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\n\n**Bestial Recovery**\n*10th-Level Conclave of the Wild feature*\nAt 10th level, while you are transformed by your Wild Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend magicka to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell cast.\n\n**Beast Spells**\n*14th-Level Conclave of the Wild feature*\nBeginning at 14th level, you can cast many of your warden spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape.

On a failed save the attacker must make their attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice. The attacking target must hear and see you in order to be affected by this feature.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest, unless you expend 6 magicka to use it again.\n\n**Bewitching Gaze**\n*14th-Level Conclave of Covens features*\nYour mastery of the fates and manipulation of creatures has granted you unparalleled magical strength. On your turn, you can target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you (no action required). If the target can see you, it must succeed on a Willpower saving throw against this magic or become charmed until the end of your next turn (as if it were affected by the charm monster spell). If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also dominated (as if it were affected by the dominate monster spell) for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this feature for the next 24 hours.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest, unless you expend 7 magicka to use it again.",

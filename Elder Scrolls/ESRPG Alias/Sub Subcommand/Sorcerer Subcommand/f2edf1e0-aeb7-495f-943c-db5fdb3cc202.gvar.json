Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.\n\n**Destructive Wrath**\n*1st-level Storm Caller feature*\nAdditionally at 1st level, you wield the power of the storm with unchecked ferocity.\n\nWhen you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or a long rest.\n\n**Overload**\n*6th-level Storm Caller feature*\nAt 6th level, you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, whenever you start casting a spell of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, stormy magic erupts from you. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your Sorcerer level.\n\n**Storm Guide**\n*6th-level Storm Caller feature*\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to subtly control the weather around you.\n\nIf it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop falling in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on you. You can end this effect as a bonus action.\n\nIf it is windy, you can use a bonus action each round to choose the direction the wind blows in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on you. The wind blows in that direction until the end of your next turn. This feature doesn't alter the speed of the wind.\n\n**Storm's Fury**\n*14th-level Storm Caller feature*\nStarting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal lightning damage to the attacker. The damage equals your sorcerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.\n\n**Wind Soul**\n*18th-level Storm Caller feature*\nAt 18th level, you gain immunity to lightning and thunder damage.\n\nYou also gain a magical flying speed of 60 feet. As an action, you can reduce your flying speed to 30 for 1 hour and choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to 3 + your Willpower modifier. The chosen creatures gain a magical flying speed of 30 feet for 1 hour. Once you reduce your flying speed in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.",

The supplicant's devotion to the daedra comes with the cost of the inability to control this powerful magic. At 1st level, replace the Daedric Blessing feature with the Wild Magic Surge feature and add the Tides of Chaos feature. At 14th level, replace Hurl Through Oblivion with the Controlled Chaos feature.\n\n**Bend Luck**\n*6th-level Supplicant feature*\nStarting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using magic.

You can apply the roll as a bonus or a penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Willpower modifier (minimum of once).

The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\n\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest occupied space. If the target is not a daedra, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n**Spell Bombardment**\n*18th-level Supplicant feature*\nBeginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies.

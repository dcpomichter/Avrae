Each of these spells must be of a level for which you can cast, as shown on the table's Spell Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new nightblade spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.\n\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the nightblade spells you know and replace it with another spell from the nightblade spell list, which also must be of a level for which you can cast.\n\n**Spellcasting Attribute.** Personality is your spellcasting attribute for your nightblade spells, so you use your Personality whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting attribute. In addition, you use your Personality modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a nightblade spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC = 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier = your Proficiency bonus + your Personality modifier\n\nTwilight Shroud Spellcasting\n```\nThief Level| Cantrips Known| Spells Known| Magicka Points| Spell Level\n------------------------------\n3rd        | 2             | 3           | 4             | 1st\n4th        | 2             | 4           | 6             | 1st\n5th        | 2             | 4           | 6             | 1st\n6th        | 2             | 4           | 6             | 1st\n7th        | 2             | 5           | 14            | 2nd\n8th        | 2             | 6           | 14            | 2nd\n9th        | 2             | 6           | 17            | 2nd\n10th       | 3             | 7           | 17            | 2nd\n11th       | 3             | 8           | 17            | 2nd\n12th       | 3             | 8           | 17            | 2nd\n13th       | 3             | 9           | 27            | 3rd\n14th       | 3             | 10          | 27            | 3rd\n15th       | 3             | 10          | 27            | 3rd\n16th       | 3             | 11          | 32            | 3rd\n17th       | 3             | 11          | 32            | 3rd\n18th       | 3             | 11          | 32            | 3rd\n19th       | 3             | 12          | 38            | 4th\n20th       | 3             | 13          | 38            | 4th\n```",

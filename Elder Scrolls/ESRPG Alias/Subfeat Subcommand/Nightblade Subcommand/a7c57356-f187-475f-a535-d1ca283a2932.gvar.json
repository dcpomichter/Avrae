Your assassin’s blade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), if you use a bonus action to summon it again, or if you fall unconscious.\n\nWhen you attack and hit a creature that is surprised with the assassin’s blade, the target takes an extra 2d6 damage from the attack. As your nightblade level increases, so does your assassin’s blade’s power. At certain levels your assassin’s blade gains new properties that increases its attack and damage rolls. At 6th level, you have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. This increases by +1 at 10th level (to +2), and again at 14th level (+3).",

In the Empire, 'High' is often understood to mean proud or snobbish, and as the Altmer generally personify these characteristics, the 'lesser races' generally resent them. Altmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Altmer being old and a 300-year-old Altmer being very, very old. Altmer consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Tamriel; the common tongue of the continent is based on Altmer speech and writing, and most of the Empire's arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from Altmer traditions.\n\nThe Altmer are the most strongly gifted in the arcane arts of all the races. They are among the longest living and intelligent races of Tamriel, and they often become powerful magic users due to both their magical affinity and the many years they may devote to their studies.\n\nTheir skin maintains a very pale golden hue, not quite the pale white of the northern human races such as Nords or Imperials, but far lighter than the Bosmer. They are slender, with prominently pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes.\n\nOn average, Altmer are of smaller build than humans, and thus generally not as strong. Their tall stature also makes them less agile than their Bosmeri cousins. However, Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on Nirn, surpassing even the Bretons in magical aptitude.\n\n**ALTMER TRAITS**\nYour Altmer character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.\n**Attribute Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2 and Willpower scores increase by 1.\n**Age.** The average Altmer can live for over 400 years, although they are known to be able to live for thousands of years. It is rumored that some Altmer on the Summerset Isles who are over 4000 years old. They reach puberty at 18 years old and are considered an adult at 30. They mature similar to humans, but their advanced age means that they are still considered young until the age of 60.\n**Alignment.** Altmer set themselves on a higher standard and tend to be lawful neutral.

Argonians possess the most alien personalities in all of Tamriel, perceived by other races as to have no personality nor emotions.\n\nThey are known as the foremost experts in guerrilla warfare throughout the Starry Heart, a reputation brought upon them by defending their borders from enemies for countless centuries. Argonians have a lifespan similar to that of humans. According to the First Era Scholar Brendan the Persistent 'the Argonian people have, throughout Tamrielic history, been perhaps the most misunderstood, vilified, and reviled of all the sentient races. Yet, those who have taken the time to experience Argonian culture have gained a greater appreciation for this noble and beautiful people'. However, it should be noted that he himself went missing in his final expedition into the deeper swamps of their homeland.\nOutside of Argonia, little is known of their homeland or native culture, and their alien physiology and customs are not well understood by scholars. They have been perhaps the most misunderstood of all the intelligent races.\n\nDespite their alien outlook, some Argonians make an effort to understand and, in their own manner, befriend people of other races. Such Argonians make faithful and skilled allies.\n\n**ARGONIAN TRAITS**\nArgonians share certain racial traits as a result of their reptilian decent.\n**Attribute Score Increase.** Your Agility score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1.\n**Age.** An argonians life is usually met with hardship and because of this, their lifespan is typically shorter than it should be.

In the Empire, they are often referred to as Wood Elves, but Bosmer, Boiche, or the Tree-Sap people is what they call themselves. Bosmer rejected the stiff, formal traditions of Aldmeri high culture, preferring a more romantic, simple existence in harmony with the land and its wild beauty and creatures. They are relatively nimble and quick in body compared to their more 'civilized' Altmeri cousins (who often look down upon the Bosmer as unruly and naive). Their agility makes them well-suited as scouts and thieves. However, they are also a quick-witted folk, and many pursue successful careers in scholarly pursuits or trading. Bosmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Bosmer being old and a 300-year-old Bosmer being very, very old. Though they are considered less influential than some of their Elven brethren, the Bosmer are also relatively prone to producing offspring. As a result, they outnumber all other mer on Tamriel.\n\nThe best archers in all of Tamriel, the Bosmer snatch and fire arrows in one continuous motion; they are even rumored to have invented the bow. They have many natural and unique abilities; notably, they can command simple-minded creatures and have a nearly chameleon-like ability to hide in forested areas. Many in the forests of Valenwood follow the tenets of the Green Pact. These 'Green Pact Bosmer' are religiously carnivorous and cannibalistic, and do not harm the vegetation of Valenwood, though they are not averse to using wooden or plant-derived products created by others.\n\nThe Bosmer are one of the smallest races in Tamriel and are born with skin colors ranging from light brown to pale tan to light green. Biologically, the Bosmer are cousins of the Dunmer, or Dark Elves, and the Altmer, or High Elves. The Wood Elves lineage is less noble than that of the Altmer, but they have adapted well to Tamriel. After the Ayleids fled mainland Cyrodiil, they joined the Bosmer in seclusion, eventually being totally assimilated by the Bosmer. This probably significantly affected biology of modern day Bosmer.\n\n**BOSMER TRAITS**\nYour Bosmer character has a variety of natural abilities common with all other Bosmer.\n**Attribute Score Increase.** Your Agility score increases by 2, and your Willpower score increases by 1.\n**Age.** Like the Altmer, Bosmer mature the same way as humans do, but they can live up to 300 years or more.\n**Alignment.** Wood elves love their freedom from the more structured societies, but they also come from a history of strict tradition. Bosmer are neutral good more often than not, but those who ignore the pact might favor the gentler aspects of chaos.\n**Size.** Bosmer are smaller and more delicate than other races, they are rarely over 5 and a half feet in height. Your size is Medium.\n**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet.\n**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Tamrielic and Bosmeri.\n**Beast Tongue.** You know the spell Speak with Animals and can cast it once with this trait.

Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, and magical elite of the feudal kingdoms that compete for power. Many are capable mages with innate resistance to magicka. They are known for a proficiency in abstract thinking and unique customs. Bretons appear, by and large, much like other pale-skinned humans. They are usually slight of build and not as muscular as Nords or Redguards. Their Elvish ancestry is usually only detectable upon a closer inspection of their eyebrows, ears, or high cheekbones, though many individual Bretons appear to be more Nordic or Imperial than anything else. The great diversity in their appearance is to be expected from their politically fractured society, though their clothes, accents, customs and names are fairly uniform.\n\nBretons are the descendants of either an Aldmeri-Nedic or Aldmeri-Atmoran hybrid race of the 1st Era and are consequently termed as 'the mongrel race of Tamriel'. Their elven blood is heavily diluted, due to their ancestors intermingling with the Nordic population in Skyrim and High Rock. Bretons are sometimes called 'Manmeri' as a result of the interbreeding, literally translating to 'man-elf'. Although their Aldmeri ancestry is shadowed by their appearance, they still inherit the magical affinity of their elven blood. Their physical features resemble their Nedic ancestors, including their pale skin tone and the obvious physical resemblance to Imperials/Nords, but some still inherit the frail, sharp appearance of the elves, along with the arrogance, and some do have slight points in their ears.\n\n**BRETON TRAITS**\nYour Breton character has certain characteristics in common with other Bretons.\n**Attribute Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Personality score increases by 1.\n**Age.** Your elven lineage allows you to live slightly longer than your human counterparts.

They are often proud, clannish, ruthless, and cruel, from an outsider's point of view, but greatly value loyalty and family. Young female Dunmer have a reputation for promiscuity in some circles. Despite their powerful skills and strengths, the Dunmer's vengeful nature, age-old conflicts, betrayals, and ill-reputation prevent them from gaining more influence. Those born in their homeland of Morrowind before its devastation were known to be considerably less friendly than those who grew up in the Imperial tradition.\n\nMost Dunmer have red, glowing eyes with skin tones varying from somewhat greenish and the more common gray to the occasional light blue. They are known to be strong, intelligent, and quick, however, are also said to be ill favored by fate. Both male and female Dunmer have a height similar to most of the human races.

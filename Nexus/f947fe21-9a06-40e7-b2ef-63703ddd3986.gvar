fate = "__**Fate Points**__\n\nIn the face of certain death, a lucky adventurer might just find a way to cheat fate and live on to fight another day. Today is a good day to survive. These rules introduce fate points for player characters and how they can use them.\n\nIf you would suffer a killing blow or fail your last death saving throw, you may spend a fate point to cheat death in some fashion.\nPerhaps you were knocked unconscious, or the scorpion's poison wasn't strong enough to finish you off, or it was just a flesh wound? Discuss with your GM exactly how it is you managed to survive your ordeal.\n\n```GM: You lie unconscious and dying, Viridian, but the orc is without mercy—she stabs down with her\nspear. Lose a death saving throw.\nViridian: Oh no, that was my last one... I'm dead. Or I would be if I didn't have one last fate point to use. Perhaps the spear missed me...?\nGM: Fate is in your favor. The spear wouldn't miss given its proximity, but let's say it missed your vital\norgans. Everyone thinks you're dead, and you remain unconscious but alive for the rest of the scene.\nViridian: Unconscious and alive sounds good to me.```\n\n***Gaining Fate***\n1st-level characters start with one fate point—a reward for becoming an adventurer in the first place. You can hold up to three fate points at any one time, and fate points can't be exchanged between characters.\nBeyond this, fate points are extremely rare. To gain fate, players must face—and defeat—the most dangerous monsters in the Wilds. Dragons, liches, beholders—these fated monsters are significant threats to the party.\nFate smiles on those who brave the darkest of these optional dangers and survive.\n**One Monster, One Point**: A fated monster rewards only 1 fate point in total when defeated—the players must decide who among them is lucky enough to take it.\n\n```GM: You hear that the black dragon Kaladax has laid waste to Merrowford and taken residence in the burnt wreckage of the town.\nClanda: Interesting. Is he a fated dragon?\nGM: Kaladax is a major power, and certainly fated.\nViridian: Could be worth investigating. I don't like being fate-less now, myself...```\n\n**Spending Fate**\n\nWhen you spend a fate point, you (usually) can't act for the rest of the scene—everyone, friend and foe alike, thinks you're dead or otherwise not worth any attention. But you are immune to any further damage during the rest of the scene, regardless of whatever else happens around your unconscious body.\nAt the end of the scene—or whenever appropriate—you regain consciousness with 1 hit point. You also recover any failed death saving throws."

survival = "__**Survival Conditions**__\n\n***Your Conditions***\nWith survival conditions, players keep track of three basic\nphysical states that can affect their character's general\nperformance: hunger, thirst, and fatigue.\nA) **Hunger**: Few things burn through calories as fast as adventuring, so keep some snacks in your pocket.\nB) **Thirst**: Adventure, travel, and combat are thirsty work. Keep a waterskin close by to avoid dehydration.\nC) **Fatigue**: It takes a keen mind to watch out for danger, so get regular sleep to stay alert and aware.\n\n\nThese basic conditions worsen naturally throughout the day, becoming more severe and—if left untreated—can eventually lead to increasing levels of exhaustion.\nDepending on the situation, this can be a real problem for your character:\n\n```Viridian has been travelling at speed through the Emerald Rift for two days, chased by the relentless\nWitch of Gloamgard. His supplies are running low, and —due to the chase—hasn't been able to rest easily in\nthe haunted woods.\nThe bard is ravenous (5 hunger), parched (3 thirst), and barely awake (6 fatigue)—he has +2 exhaustion from his conditions, cutting his speed in half. Unless Viridian can find food fast for some quick energy, the dreaded Witch will be right on his heels.```\n\nKeep an eye on your conditions and use your supplies to manage them as best you can—eat food to stave off\nhunger, drink water to quench your thirst, and get some sleep to remove your fatigue.\n\n**Gaining a Condition**\nCharacters gain hunger, thirst, and fatigue in four primary ways whilst  adventuring: through the natural passage of time, by falling to 0 hit points, through failure consequences, and by suffering certain monster attacks.\n\n*Time Of Day*\nAs the day progresses, characters become more hungry, thirsty, and tired. Conditions worsen at dawn, noon, and dusk—the specific effects are listed in the table below.\n\n`Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue\n  Time    Hunger    Thirst    Fatigue  \n ------- --------- --------- --------- \n  Dawn    +1        +1        —        \n  Noon    —         —         +1       \n  Dusk    +1        +1        +1       `\n\nAcross a normal, uneventful day, a character will gain +2 hunger, +2 thirst, and +2 fatigue—this means a character needs 2 rations of food, 2 rations of water, and a good night's sleep each day to stay in good form.\nDuring the adventure, the GM—or whoever else is keeping track of time—announces the changes in character conditions when appropriate.\n\n*Falling to 0 hp*\nNearing death is an exhausting shock to the body. If you fall to 0 hit points for any reason—including shapeshifted forms such as Wild Shape—you gain +1 fatigue\n\n*Consequences*\nYou may gain survival conditions as a consequence of failing an action, at your GM's discretion—or offer to gain a condition and succeed at a cost.\n\n*Monster Attacks*\nMonster and environmental effects can drain characters of their stamina and resources. There will be condition modifiers to some of the existing monster attacks and traps—or add brand new condition-causing powers.\n> -A fire elemental burns the air around you with a blast of searing heat: you gain +1 thirst.\n> -A green ooze wraps around your arm and sucks the nutrients from your flesh: you gain +1 hunger.\n> -An eldritch mage whispers a cacophonous verse and commands you to sleep: you gain +1 fatigue\n\n**Improving Your Condition**\nWhenever appropriate, your character can attempt to improve their physical condition in a manner that makes sense. Some of the most common actions are:\n> **Eat a ration of food**: −1 hunger per ration. Better quality food may relieve more hunger per ration.\n> **Drink a ration of water**: −1 thirst per ration. Better quality water may relieve more thirst per ration.\n> **Get a good night's sleep**: (undisturbed) −3 fatigue. A disturbed night's sleep grants only −1 fatigue."

survival2 = "__**Survival Conditions**__\n\n***Exhaustion***\n\nAs your character's condition worsens, they become increasingly more exhausted. Whenever a condition reaches stage 5 or 6, it generates +1 exhaustion—for a maximum of +3 exhaustion across all conditions.\n\n```Valiant is ravenous (5 hunger), dry (5 thirst), and barely awake (6 fatigue)—he has +3 exhaustion from his unfortunate conditions.\nUnable to find food, he later finds himself starving (6 hunger). His exhaustion remains at +3.```\n\n**Persistent**: Once a condition has begun to cause exhaustion, that exhaustion remains on your character until the condition is sufficiently improved (such as by\nbeing reduced to stage 4 or lower).\n\n**Relieving Exhaustion**\nA condition stops causing exhaustion once it has been improved to stage 4 or higher. After the next short rest, update the character's exhaustion counters.\n\n```Valiant finds a cache of food supplies. He immediately eats 3 rations-worth, healing 3 hunger and improving his overall condition to Peckish.\nHis Hunger condition continues to add +1 exhaustion until he takes a short rest, at which point his total exhaustion drops from +3 to +2.```\n\n***Stamina Check***\nIt's hard work being an adventurer—battles to fight, ropes to climb, rivers to swim—and such activity can be draining to those without the proper constitution.\nAfter a particularly strenuous event, the GM can ask you to make a Stamina check (Constitution saving throw) against the DC of your best condition. A failure means that your stamina was tapped during the event—roll a d6 to see which condition worsens.\n> 1-2: +1 Hunger\n> 3-4: +1 Thirst\n> 5-6: +1 Fatigue\n\n```GM: The last goblin drops his dagger and flees into the night. Well done, everyone. Now roll a Stamina check.\nValiant: 14. I didn't break a sweat.\nSarien: 9. That's what I get for skipping breakfast...\n(rolls 6) ...+1 fatigue. Getting sleepy here.\nClanda: 7. Damn, not enough. I gain... (rolls 4) ...+1 thirst. Great, and my waterskin's dry already. Anyone got a drink? I'm feeling pretty thirsty right now.```"

stress = "__**Stress And Afflictions**__\n\n***Stress***\nStress is a measure of pressure on a character's mental state, representing a build-up of negative emotions such as anger, fear, frustration, and irritation. Too much Stress is bad for your mental health and, if not treated carefully, can lead to detrimental Afflictions—or even death.\nCharacters can suffer up to 40 points of Stress before they reach breaking point. To prevent this, they'll need to find ways to relax and recover during downtime.\n\n**Gaining Stress**\nStress is gained through danger, hardship, and adversity— suffering a critical hit from an enemy, hearing an unearthly moan from a dark room, sleeping rough in the cold rain, watching an ally die. Anything that threatens the mental well-being of your character can inflict Stress.\nWhen choosing how much Stress to inflict, decide how significant the event is to the character—is it minor, moderate, major, or monstrous? The more emotionally significant, the higher the amount of Stress.\nThe more an event conflicts with the fundamental nature of your character, the greater the amount of Stress you'll suffer—a bard may be more embarrassed to ruin a performance than a wizard, while a lawful paladin is more hurt by a broken oath than a lawless rogue.\n\nMinor Stress\n>  +1 stress| A small frustration, worry, or irritant: missing an attack, falling down, hearing a noise in the dark.\n\nModerate Stress \n> +2 (1d4) stress | You've made a critical error or something is seriously at risk: being caught lying, learning that the villain has escaped, being outnumbered.\n\nMajor Stress \n> +4 (1d6) stress | Something devastating to your character or their beliefs: breaking an oath, falling to 0  hp, finding a heap of fresh corpses.\n\nMonstrous Stress\n>  +8 (1d6 + 4) stress | Something incomprehensible or world-shattering: meeting a god, being betrayed by your closest friend, watching a loved one die.\n\n*Consequential Stress*\nYou can gain Stress as a direct consequence of failing an action—missing an attack, breaking a lockpick, being caught in the middle of a lie. The GM will usually notify you that this is a risk before you make your attempt.\nHere we see Chansi attempt—and fail—to pick a lock.\n\n```Chansi: Ok, let's see what's in this chest. I want to pick the lock on this thing—what's the DC?\nGM: It's a secure metal chest, so DC 20. You will gain 1 point of Stress if you fail.\nChansi: Easy. Lemme just... (rolls 15) ...ugh, fail.\nGM: You hear the pins clicking in the lock, Chansi, but you can't understand why they're not setting. It's a frustrating failure for you—gain 1 point of Stress.```\n\n*Stress Check*\nIn cases where the environment or situation provokes an emotional response—standing before a dragon, entering a decrepit tomb, hearing a terrifying sound—you may be asked to pass a Stress check (Wisdom saving throw) to avoid gaining some Stress.\nIn this example, Viridian comes across a pile of rotting corpses and must pass a Stress check to keep his composure and avoid gaining Stress.\n\n```GM: You smell something foul, Viridian. Behind the wooden door, you can hear a faint buzzing sound.\nViridian: I open the door cautiously.\nGM: Your torchlight illuminates a grisly scene—a dozen rotting corpses hidden in a small pantry, covered in a thick swarm of fat flies. The putrid stench of rotting flesh threatens to overwhelm you.\nMake a Stress check, DC 20.\nViridian: I'm... (rolls 22) ...phew, ok.\nGM: Horrifying though this is, you manage to retain your composure. Perhaps this isn't the first time you've seen a heap of rotting corpses?```"

stress2 = "__**Stress And Afflictions**__\n\n**Snapping**\nToo much Stress can be unhealthy for your character, causing long-term problems. When your character gains 20, 30, and 35 points of Stress for the first time after a long rest, they snap and develop a mental Affliction.\n\n```GM: In a very surprising turn of events, Krazak failed to smash open the chest with his headbutt. Krazak, you gain 1 point of Stress.\nKrazak: These gods damned elven boxes. I'm up to 20 now—I've snapped. Time for a new Affliction...```\n\n**Breaking Point**\nWhen a character gains 40 points of Stress, they hit breaking point. In this state, your character is reckless, dangerous, and extremely vulnerable.\nIf you are hit by a damaging attack while at breaking point, your character suffers a fatal heart attack. You fall to 0 hit points, fail any remaining death saving throws, and die immediately.\n\n```GM: The dragon lashes out at you, Clanda, swinging its huge tail. Make a defense roll, DC 32.\nClanda: I... (rolls a natural 1) ...ouch, take a critical hit.\nGM: The dragon's tail slams into you without mercy.\nTake 26 points of damage, one notch on your armor, and 2 points of Stress.\nClanda: Damn, that puts me at 40 Stress.\nGM: Your heart is pounding, Clanda, and it's hard to breathe. You're not sure you can take another hit...```\n\n**Healing Stress**\nStress is healed through success and relaxation—disarming a trap, defeating a formidable opponent, carousing in town, sleeping in a warm bed. Anything that helps your character feel better can heal Stress.\nThe amount healed depends on the significance to your character. The more it aligns with your character's personality, the more you heal (at the GM's discretion)— rogues benefits more than mages from lockpicking, while clerics benefit more than fighters from prayer.\n\n\nMinor Stress Heal \n> −1 Stress heal | A small success or bit of good news: disarming a trap,  playing a song, relaxing with your friends.\n\nModerate Stress Heal  \n> −2 Stress heal (1d4) | A critical success or special achievement: eating a well-cooked meal, finding a hoard of treasure, repairing something  important.\n\nMajor Stress Heal  \n> −4 (1d6) Stress heal | You've beaten the odds and gained a major victory: defeating a dangerous enemy, saving an ally from death, completing a work of art.\n\nMajestic Stress Heal  \n> −8 (1d6 + 4) Stress heal | You've achieved a long-term goal or done something thought near impossible: bringing a friend back from death, finishing a masterpiece, receiving praise from your deity.\n\nIt is much harder to heal Stress than it is to gain it, so you'll need to be proactive in treating your Stress level before it becomes insurmountable. Rest when you can, and try not to over-exert yourself.\n\n*Downtime During Camping*\nWhile out travelling, a good time to heal Stress is during downtime and through sleep. Here, Sarien takes advantage of his downtime during a night's rest to meditate and clear his mind.\n\n*Taking A Long Rest*\nWhen you complete a long rest in a sanctuary, such as a village, town, or city, you heal all stress. Reduce your Stress level to 0.\n\n*Calm Emotions*\nWhen you are affected by the Calm Emotions spell—or other similar magic spells and effects—you heal a moderate amount of Stress.\n\n```Stress Relief\nThese are some things a character might do to reduce their stress levels. Not everyone will recover in the same way—an introvert may unwind best on their own with a good book and some hot tea, while an extrovert may want to throw a raucous and extravagant party to blow off steam.\nDisarming a trap\nDefeating a dangerous enemy\nEating a hot, well-cooked meal\nMaking people laugh with a joke\nListening to a bard perform a song\nCarousing in a rowdy tavern\nPicking a lock\nSleeping in a warm, comfortable bed\nPraying to your deity\nFinding a chest of treasure\nArriving somewhere safely after a long journey\nSpending time with family and friends\nLearning a new skill\nEngaging in a hobby\nPlaying with a pet\nRolling dice and playing some games\nFulfilling an oath or promise\nProtecting an ally from harm\nMeditating and resting\nMaking a discovery```"

Afflictions affect your character's abilities and can only be cured during downtime.\nWhen you gain 20, 30, and 35 Stress for the first time after a long rest, roll on the Afflictions table to see which new mental Affliction you develop.

During a long rest, your character can attempt to treat one of their Afflictions in an appropriate fashion—carousing, praying,\nresting, meditating, etc.\nSpend some gold to roll a d20 to make an Affliction Removal attempt. Some downtime activities, such as resting, may allow you to roll with advantage—bear this in mind if your Afflictions are proving hard to clear, before you become overwhelmed by them.\n\n`Affliction Removal\n01 **Critical Failure**: You fail to cure your Affliction, gaining a new one in the process.\n02-09 **Failure**: You fail to cure your Affliction.\n10-19 **Success**: You cured your Affliction.\n20 **Critical Success**: In a moment of clarity, you cleared yourself of all Afflictions and Stress.`\nYou can only make one Affliction Removal attempt per in-game week, so make the best of it.\n\n*Costs*\nAs you gain in experience, it becomes harder to reset your mental state—the things you have seen and experienced have had a lasting impact.

Any of the below skills.\n> Athletics: You help by moving something heavy to clear\n> space for the camp.\n> Animal Handling: You help by checking the site isn't in\n> the territory of any dangerous, wild animals.\n> Nature: You help by finding good wood—and other\n> natural fuel—for the campfire.\n> Religion: You help by channeling divine power from\n> your deity to bless the campsite.\n\nCamping Check DC\n> Dc: 5. Safe, dry land is easy to find / the weather is clear.\n> Dc: 10. Safe, dry land is easy to find but there is light rain or low winds.\n> Dc: 15. A campsite requires effort to find / there's bad weather—heavy rain, heavy snow, heavy fog, High Winds etc.\n> Dc: 20. It's hard to find a safe campsite / the weather is terrible—Storm.\n\nCamping Results\n> 0 failures:  A perfect campsite. Activity checks are DC 5.\n> 1 failure: A decent campsite with one glaring flaw.\n> Activity checks are DC 10.\n> 2 or more failures: A shoddy campsite just barely fit for purpose.\n> Activity checks are DC 15.\n\n**Camping Equipment**\nIt's hard to set up camp if you're relying on nature alone to provide you with shelter and comfort. If you don't have any appropriate camping equipment—such as a bedroll or tent\n—roll your Camping check with disadvantage. Some equipment, such as a two-person tent, may count as camping gear for multiple people—if they're willing to share.\n\n**Nominate The Lookout**\nIt's a big risk to set up camp without appointing someone to watch out for any would-be intruders. A lookout is in charge of camp security and keeps an eye out for potential threats.\nIf you are the lookout, roll an Intelligence (Survival) check to see how well you secure the camp against potential dangers. If you have any tools, equipment, or magic that might help—traps, bells, the Alarm spell—you may roll your check with advantage.\nSuccess: You noted some weak spots in the camp's defense and secured them. Everyone Heals a minor amount of Stress.\nFailure: You made a bad job of securing the camp. You have disadvantage on perception checks against any would-be intruders while camping. Everyone gains a minor amount of Stress.\n\nBeing on lookout takes a good deal of focus. If you are on lookout, you can't join in with any camp activities besides eating, drinking, and sleeping.\n\n **Note:** Lookout and any other camping activities can only be done by player characters. Familiars, animal companions, npcs, etc cannot do them for gameplay purposes.\n\n**Perform Camp Activities**\nHere is a list of Camping activities.\n> Lookout :eye:\n> Gather Reagents :herb: \n> Gather Materials :pick: \n> Forage :basket: \n> Survey :telescope: \n> Track :feet: \n> Cooking :cooking: \n> Brewing :beer: \n> Crafting :tools: \n> Play Music :notes: \n> Tell A Story :book: \n> Repair An Item :hammer: \n> Play A Game :game_die: \n> Relax In Solitude :man_in_lotus_position:\nUse `!ca` to take a closer look about each activity."

camp2 = "__**Camping**__\n\n***Getting Some Sleep***\nSometimes the best way to clear your mind is to shut it down for a while—rest is often the best medicine.\nWhen you attempt to sleep, make a sleeping check (Constitution saving throw) against the Camping Activity DC—if you are sleeping in a bedroll or tent, you can make the roll with advantage.\nSuccess: Your sleep was undisturbed. Regain 1 spent hit die (max. once per day) and you heal 3 fatigue and a major amount of Stress.\nFailure: You couldn't sleep well, waking up tired. You gain a moderate amount of Stress and heal only 1 fatigue\n\n**Trance**\nSome races don't sleep as others do—instead, they fall into a meditative state known as a Trance. In this state, your character is semi-conscious and only partially-aware of their surroundings.\nWhile you are in a trance, you have disadvantage on all Perception rolls. You may, however, roll your sleeping checks as normal.\n\n**Wearing Armor**\nArmor—while great for defense—does not make for comfortable sleeping attire. If you choose to keep your armor on while you sleep, you must roll your sleeping\ncheck with disadvantage.\n\n**The Lookout**\nWhile the lookout is on active guard duty, they can still make a sleeping check—simply assume that they find some time to have a quick nap whilst the other party members are still awake.\nThe lookout rolls their sleeping check with disadvantage, however—it's hard to feel completely refreshed after a night on watch. \n **Note:**This disadvantage cannot be avoided. The Lookout takes few quick naps so they dont use their bedroll. Its better to lend it to someone who doesnt have one. \n\n**Ambushed!**\nA warm campfire and the smell of delicious, hot food can attract attention out in the dark wilds—from cruel bandits, to hungry bears, to bloodthirsty cultists. If you let your guard down, you might find both your sleep and your life\ncut surprisingly short.\nIf an intruder approaches, the lookout rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check against the intruder's Stealth:\nSuccess: The lookout is able to detect the intruders and, if they choose to, rouse the party with enough time for people to don light armor.\nFailure: The lookout—and the rest of the party—are caught off-guard and surprised. You (only you) gain a moderate amount of Stress.\n\n***Useful Magic Spells***\nMagic can be a great help when travelling, providing valuable light, heat, and supplies when needed most.\nBelow are some spells that may prove useful during your time in camp and some of their potential benefits:\n> **Alarm**\n> This spell grants the lookout advantage on any perception\n> checks made to detect intruders.\n> \n> **Create Bonfire**\n> This spell can be used to generate 1 automatic success when setting up camp, assuming there is flammable material around with which to build a long-term fire.\n> \n> **Create Food And Water**\n> One use of this spell can heal 3 hunger and 3 thirst from up to 15 creatures. As a magical consumable, a creature gains this benefit only once per day.\n> \n> **Create Or Destroy Water**\n> One use of this spell can fill up to 5 waterskins (a total of 25 water rations). For each spell slot above 1st-level, you can fill another 5 waterskins.\n> \n> **GoodBerry**\n> A goodberry heals 1 hit point and 1 hunger when eaten. As a magical consumable, a creature gains this benefit only once per day.\n> \n> **Heroes Feast**\n> One use of this spell can heal 6 hunger and 6 thirst from up to 12 creatures. As a magical consumable, a creature gains this benefit only once per day.\n> \n> **Leomund's Tiny Hut**\n> When used to protect the camp, this spell grants the lookout an automatic success on their activity checks in addition to its other benefits.\n> \n> **Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound**\n> The hound grants you advantage on any perception checks\n> made to detect intruders."

longrest = "__**Long Rest And Downtime**__\n\nEventually, everyone wants to come home— home is where the heart is. A place to put your feet up, reflect on your recent adventures, and prepare for adventures yet to come.\nThese rules define the long rest period and activities you might pursue during your downtime.\n\n***Taking a Long Rest***\nA long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 1 week long, in which your character performs downtime activities and pursues their own interests.\nFollow these 6 steps for each week of rest:\n\n**Sell loot**: Trade in any loot and treasure—gemstones, paintings, fine goblets—gained on your adventures and\ngain gold and experience.\n\n**Choose lifestyle**: Choose your quality of lifestyle for the week—wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable,\nwealthy, or aristocratic. You'll usually need to pay for this upfront.\n\n**Choose primary activity**: Choose your primary downtime activity and pay any relevant costs.\n\n**Perform secondary activities**: You can do 2 other small, secondary activities during your week—meet someone, go shopping, relieve some stress, etc.\n\n**Settle up**: It's the end of the week—gain the result of your primary activity (level up, wages, information, etc) and check to see if your wounds and Afflictions recover.\nIf you have any outstanding debts, settle up.\n\n**Sell Loot**\nIf you found any valuables on your adventure—precious gemstones, golden goblets, fine paintings—you can sell\nthem at the start of your long rest.\nSome valuables may be too exotic for the average merchant to buy—magic items, archaeological tablets,\ncursed rings—and you'll need to spend your week searching for a suitable buyer.\n\n**Choose Your Lifestyle**\nYour lifestyle determines the level of comfort you live in during your week and the types of people you'll be\nsurrounded by—if you aim to meet nobles and other aristocrats, you'll need to support an expensive lifestyle.\nThe Lifestyle Conditions table shows the lifestyle cost for an adventurer in gold pieces per week, and the condition it leaves you in at the end of the week.\n\nLifestyle: Wretched \n> Cost per Week: 0 gp\n> Max hp: 50%\n> Starting HD: 0\n> Hunger: Starving\n> Thirst: Dehydrated \n> Fatigue: Barely Awake\n\nLifestyle: Squalid\n> Cost per Week: 0.5 gp\n> Max hp: 50%\n> Starting HD:  25%\n> Hunger: Ravenous\n> Thirst: Dry\n> Fatigue: Very Sleepy\n\nLifestyle: Poor\n> Cost per Week: 1.5 gp\n> Max hp: 75%\n> Starting HD:  50%\n> Hunger: Hungry\n> Thirst: Thirsty\n> Fatigue: Sleepy\n\nLifestyle: Modest\n> Cost per Week: 8 gp\n> Max hp: 100%\n> Starting HD: 75%\n> Hunger: Peckish\n> Thirst: Parched\n> Fatigue: Tired\n\nLifestyle: Comfortable\n> Cost per Week: 15 gp\n> Max hp: 100%\n> Starting HD: 100%\n> Hunger: Ok\n> Thirst: Ok\n> Fatigue: Ok\n\nLifestyle: Wealthy\n> Cost per Week: 30 gp\n> Max hp: 110%\n> Starting HD: 100%\n> Hunger: Well-fed\n> Thirst: Refreshed\n> Fatigue: Well Rested\n\nLifestyle: Aristocratic\n> Cost per Week: 70+ gp\n> Max hp: 120%\n> Starting HD: 100%\n> Hunger: Stuffed\n> Thirst: Quenched\n> Fatigue: Energised\n\n**Maximum Hit Points And Hit Dice**\nYour lifestyle has a major impact on your health. Once you complete a long rest, update your maximum hit points and starting hit dice to match your lifestyle."

longrest2 = "__**Long Rest And Downtime**__\n\n**Pick A Primary Activity**\nDuring your long rest, you'll have time to pursue a primary interest. This is the main focus of your week and something you spend roughly half of each day on, leaving a quarter-day for sleep and a quarter for miscellaneous activity—shopping, eating, basic socializing, etc.\nYou only have time to perform one primary activity per week—this is your primary focus for the days ahead.\nChoose one from the suggestions below, or discuss one with your GM.\n\nWork for Coin\nFind a Rare Merchant\nSell an Exotic Item\nCraft an Item\nLearn a Tool\nResearch\nTraining\nCarouse & Socialize\nRest & Relaxation\nVolunteer Work\nCriminal Activity\nPerform a Service\nLearn a Language\n\n```Specific rules and advice for some primary activities are covered in and Xanathar's Guide to Everything (p123-134).```\n\n*Activity Complications*\nYour activity has a small chance of generating a complication that may make life more difficult—hurting yourself working, offending a lord while carousing, damaging a priceless book while researching. \nAt the end of each week, roll a d10—on a 1, something unfortunate happens as a result of your activities.\n\n**Two Secondary Activities**\nA secondary activity is something that only takes a short amount of time to do, from a few hours to a whole day.\nDuring a week of long rest, you have enough spare time to do two secondary activities. Choose them from the suggestions below, or discuss one with your GM:\n> **Meet Someone**: Arrange or attend a meeting with a person, group, or faction in town.\n> \n> **Trade Gear**: Buy and sell some mundane gear and equipment from merchants around town.\n> \n> **Investigate Rumor**: Spend some time investigating a rumor to see if it's actually true.\n\n**Settle Up**\nAt the end of your week, settle up your debts and reap any rewards from your primary activity. Check to see if any of your long-term wounds or injuries have healed, and start preparing for your next adventure.\nCompleting a long rest automatically resets your Stress level to 0. You may also\npay gold to make an Affliction Removal check if you have not already rolled one this week.\n\n***Leveling Up***\nYour character gains experience by being an active force—making new discoveries, overcoming great obstacles, and changing the world (for good or for\nill). With enough experience, your character can open up pathways to greater power, knowledge, and influence.\nSuch power comes at a cost, however, requiring time and effort to unlock. This chapter sets out rules for training and mentors.\n\nOnce you've gained enough experience, you can begin training to improve your abilities and unlock new heights of power. Through experimentation with your new-found knowledge—practicing new techniques, developing new\nspells, channeling new power—you can spend your experience points to gain a level.\nBut training is not easy or cheap. In addition to the experience, you'll also need Gold.\n\nTo see how long you need to train per level, and how much it will cost you, check the Training Time & Costs table below. These costs don't cover your regular living\nexpenses—you'll need to cover those separately, so make sure to keep enough coin spare.\n\n`\n  Level    Weeks    GP/Week  \n -------- -------- --------- \n  0-1          1         10  \n  1-2          1         15  \n  2-3          1         20  \n  3-4          2         15  \n  4-5          2         20  \n  5-6          3         25  \n  6-7          3         35  \n  7-8          4         37  \n  8-9          4         55  \n  9-10         5         64  \n  10-11        5         94  \n  11-12        6        115  \n  12-13        6        165  \n  13-14        7        202  \n  14-15        7        295  \n  15-16        8        370  \n  16-17        8        536  \n  17-18        9        687  \n  18-19        9        990  \n  19-20       10      1,280  `\n\nYou don't have to complete your training in one unbroken block—you can pause it to go adventuring and resume your training again from where you left off once\nyou have some free time."

explore = "__**Exploration Phase**__\n\nExploration phase is used when a group has reached their region of choice and is now exploring it. Time passes in 4 hour chunks called watches.\n\n**Watches**:\n> Most activities and events conducted during an exploration phase can be  divided into watches, a standard unit of time used for longer-term play. In an ordinary 24-hour day, there are six watches, each equivalent to about four hours. Watches are kind of “exploration turn,” and are used in navigation, travel activities, weather patterns, and more.\n> An ordinary party can travel for two watches, or eight hours.\n> A character needs two watches of sleep, or, again, eight hours. This leaves another two watches during which other activities can be conducted, such as fighting monsters, delving into dungeons, or foraging for supplies.\n> It’s important to note that watches do not have to synchronize perfectly. Watches used in weather patterns do not necessarily change at the same time a travelling party’s watches do. Think of watches less as strict locked units as much as a useful shorthand for gauging occurrences and states over longer lengths of time.\n\n**Exploration Activities**:\nWhile characters are exploring, there are a number of activities that they can undertake. A character can only engage in one Exploration activity at a time. A character decides which activity they are engaging in at the start of each watch that they are exploring. Most Exploration activities are done passively while exploring, and thus can be stopped or started at any time; foraging is the exception: a character must spend the full watch foraging in order to find food or water.\nIf the party stops exploring and has no pressing activities, a character could simply continue foraging for their remaining time.\nA party member may engage in one of the following activities during a watch:\n> Notice threats :eye: \n> Gather Reagents :herb: \n> Gather Materials :pick: \n> Navigate :compass: \n> Forage :basket: \n> Track :feet: \n> Draw a map :map:\n\nUse `!explore` or `!ea` for more information for each activity.\n\n**Exploration Pace**\nWhile exploring, characters may sometimes wish to explore at a faster pace, and other times at a slower one, depending on a variety of factors.\nWhile exploring, a group of adventurers can move at a normal fast, or slow pace.  \nExploring at a fast pace makes characters less perceptive and unable to focus on anything but the road, while a slow exploration pace makes it possible to sneak around and to traverse the area more carefully.\nCharacters can explore for 8 hours—two watches—per day normally, incurring no penalties. However, a party can push beyond this limit, at the risk of exhaustion. For each additional hour of exploration beyond 8 hours, the characters cover an hour’s distance at their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour.\nThe DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a characters suffers one level of exhaustion.\n\nFast Pace. At a fast pace, characters suffer a -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, a -5 penalty to Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate or track, and cannot engage in exploration activities other than noticing threats, navigating, or tracking.\n\nNormal Pace. A normal pace has no additional effects.\n\nSlow Pace. While exploring at a slow pace, characters are able to explore stealthily, and gain a +5 bonus to Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate or track. Enables gathering checks."

delve = "# __**Delving Phase**__\nDuring this Phase, time passes in 10 minute increments. \n\n## Tension Pool\nI use a system to track time called Tension pool. Basically every 10 minutes, a d6 🎲  enters the tension pool. Signifying the rising of potential danger. When the pool reaches 6d6, it means an hour passes and then i roll those dice. If even one of them lands on a 1, a complication occurs. Then the tension pool gets cleared and a new hour starts.\nWhen a character does something **reckless**, the tension pool is rolled with however dice it has in it.\nSo if the players are careful all the time and going slowly through the areas/rooms, they should get an encounter roll every hour.\nIf people decide to be **reckless**, make noise, move fast through rooms etc, then more encounter rolls will happen. Which means that people might want to go slower and careful when there are many dice in the pool. Cause the chance of rolling a 1 are higher. At the start of the hour though, where there is no dice (DM always rolls a minimum of one die) is the best time to do reckless things.\n\nSome times a slow action can be **reckless **at the same time. When that happens, dm adds a die to the pool and then rolls the pool.\n\n\n### Short Rests\nIf the players decide to do a short rest, the DM rolls a full tension pool of 6 dice and then continues with the same number of tension dice that were in the pool before the short rest.\n\n**Important.** \nThe tension pool will only get cleared when it reaches 6 dice. \n\n**__Scene Resolution__**\n\nWhen a new scene is introduced, the dm will wait for all players to react to the scene.\nThere are 3 types of actions.\nSpeak action, fast action, slow action.\n\n\n[⁠Speak Actions](https://discord.com/channels/779208086627811361/1151820637946523689)\n⁠[Fast Actions](https://discord.com/channels/779208086627811361/1151820424729075742)\n⁠[Slow Actions](https://discord.com/channels/779208086627811361/1151820038660177920)"

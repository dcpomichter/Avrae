wound2 = "__**Wounds And Injuries**__\n\n***Permanent Injuries***\nSome monsters are especially deadly, destructive, and vicious—when they hit, they hit hard enough to break bones and sever limbs. Dragons, giants, ogres—if it's huge, its attacks are usually extremely violent.\nIf you are reduced to 0 hit points by a violent attack, you suffer a debilitating Permanent Injury. Roll to see which injury you suffer—reroll any nonsensical result.\n\n`\n  d10    Injury                             Treatment            \n  1      Lose an arm                        Prosthesis (arm)     \n  2      Lose a leg                         Prosthesis (leg)     \n  3      Lose a hand                        Prosthesis (hand)    \n  4      Lose a foot                        Prosthesis (foot)    \n  5      Lose an eye                        Prosthesis (eye)     \n  6      Lose a toe                         Medical aid (DC 15)  \n  7      Lose a finger                      Medical aid (DC 15)  \n  8      Gain a horrific, scarring wound    Medical aid (DC 20)  \n  9      Gain an internal injury            Medical aid (DC 20)  \n  10     Lose half your teeth               Medical aid (DC 20)  `\n\nWhen you gain an injury, you also gain a level of exhaustion. As with lingering wounds, this exhaustion is permanent until you treat the injury in some fashion.\n\n**Treating Injuries**\nOnce you gain an injury, it remains active on your character and causes exhaustion until it is treated. There are three common ways to treat an injury:\n> **Prosthetics**: Wear a prosthetic device to replace a missing body part.\n> **Medical Aid**: Receive medical attention—even surgery— to close up major damage and internal bleeding. This can only be done during a long rest when you are in a safe place—a village, town, or city.\n> **Magic**: Injuries can be reversed with the Greater Restoration spell (or something of equivalent power).\nOnce an injury has been treated, the exhaustion is lifted\nand your character can act normally again.\n\n***Prosthetics*** \nA prosthesis is an artificial device that can replace or augment a missing (or injured) body part—such as an arm, leg, or eye. You may find prosthetics on your adventures or buy them from artificers, crafters, and healers.\n\nFalse Leg (common): \n> A wooden leg with a secret compartment that can hold a small item. Wearing this treats a missing leg injury.\n\nGlass Eye (common):\n> A glass orb made to look like a tabaxi eye. Wearing this treats a missing eye injury.\n\n**Magical Prosthetics**\nSome prosthetics have been augmented with magic, granting them extra properties. These are much rarer in the world—and far, far more expensive.\n\n**Arm Of Living Bark** (rare)\n> A prosthetic arm crafted from living wood. It has a tendency to reach towards bright sunlight when the owner is distracted. Wearing this treats a missing arm injury\n> **Nature's Grasp**: Once per short rest, you may use a free action to stretch out the vines in your arm and extend your reach by 5ft until the end of your turn.\n\n**Foot Of Cloud Walking** (rare)\n> A prosthetic foot inscribed with an air enchantment. It weighs half as much as you would normally expect for its size. Wearing this treats a missing foot injury.\n> **Cloudwalk**: Once per short rest, you may jump twice as far or twice as high as you normally would.\n\n**Hand Of Static** (rare)\n> A metal prosthetic hand, dwarven-forged and inscribed with arcane glyphs and sigils. It crackles if left uncovered in the rain. Wearing this treats a missing hand injury.\n> **Statick Shock**: Once per short rest, when you make a successful melee attack, you may use a free action to add 2d6 lightning damage to your damage."

druid = "__**Druid**__\n***Wild Shape***\nStarting at 2nd-level, you gain access to the Wild Shape feature. This ability is subject to the following changes:\n> **Attack Bonus / Ability DCs**: When in wild shape, calculate your attack bonus and any ability DCs using either your shape's proficiency bonus or your own— whichever is highest. You are proficient in whichever forms of attack the shape is proficient in.\n> **Defenses / Damage**: Your wild shape's defenses and attack damage values are unchanged.\n> **Hit Points**: When in wild shape, your hit point maximum is equal to either the shape's default or six times your druid level—whichever is highest.\n> **0 Hit Points**: If you are reduced to 0 hit points whilst in a wild shape, you revert to your normal form and lose one unspent hit die or suffer a level of exhaustion if you have no hit dice remaining.\n> **Multiattack**: You can't use multiattack in your new form until you are a 5th-level druid (or higher).\n\n***Wild Bestiary***\nAs a druid, you can shapeshift into a number of different wild shapes—this collection is called your wild bestiary.\nYour bestiary can hold a total number of shapes equal to your druid level. If you forget a shape from your bestiary, you will have to relearn it again.\n**Learning a New Wild Shape**\n> To add a new shape to your bestiary (or replace an existing one), you must closely observe a live beast to study it. This requires 1 hour of focus per CR of the beast (minimum 1 hour), during which you develop a primal understanding of the creature's essence.\n> If the beast is friendly, reduce the required time by half —but if it is acting hostile, double the time.\n> `Interrupted Focus: If your efforts are significantly\n> interrupted—the beast escapes, you fall asleep, a combat\n> encounter begins, etc—you lose your focus and must start\n> your observations again from the beginning.`\n\n**Going on a Wild Hunt**\n> To find a beast and master its wild shape, many druids begin a wild hunt. Depending on the beast, location, and the length of time required, you may need to make several skill checks during your wild hunt to see if you are successful in your efforts.\n> Skills (such as Animal Handling, Insight, Nature, Stealth, and Survival) and magic spells (such as Animal Friendship, Speak with Animals, and Locate Animals or Plants) may be of particular help during a wild hunt."

As a direct manifestation of your patron's power, you may decide on the appearance of your eldritch blast.\nThis spell is now a dedicated warlock class feature and can be removed from all class spell lists—the only way to learn Eldritch Blast is to become a warlock (or be granted it by a specific class feature).\n\n**Eldritch Scaling**\nAs a class feature, Eldritch Blast now scales with your warlock class level—not your character level.\n\nEldritch Blast new Description\n> A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.\n> The spell creates more beams as you gain more warlock class levels: two beams at 5th-level, three beams at 11thlevel, and four beams at 17th-level. You can direct the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.\n\n\n**Pact Weapon Feature**\nAs an action on your turn, you create a pact weapon in your empty hand.

This weapon counts as magical when overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\n> \n> **Ephemeral**: This weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, if you create another pact weapon, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\n> \n> **Magic Weapons**: You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. \n> The weapon ceases to be your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.

inv = "__**Inventory management rules**__\nThese rules introduce inventory slots, object bulk, and new systems to help you manage your inventory.\n\n***Slots and Bulk***\nThis system manages items using inventory slots (storage capacity) and object bulk (carrying effort).\n**Inventory Slots:**\n> Inventory slots describe storage capacity—how much can a thing carry without being overwhelmed? One slot holds one small object—a potion bottle, a dagger, a loaf of bread, etc.\n> Anything that can hold, carry, or contain objects can make use of inventory slots—for example:\n> **Creatures **use slots to describe how much they can carry before they're encumbered.\n> **Containers **use slots to describe how much they can store before they're full.\n> **Buildings **use slots to describe how much free space they have in their rooms.\n> **Vehicles **use slots to describe how much they can transport before they can't move.\n\n**Bulk**\n> Objects use bulk to describe how many inventory slots they fill—the bulkier the object, the more slots occupied.\n> Bulk represents the effort needed by a medium-sized creature to carry an object based on its size, weight, and shape—the more awkward or uncomfortable it is to hold an object, the higher its bulk.\n\n***Your Inventory***\nYour inventory capacity depends on your creature size and strength modifier or constitution modifier (whichever is highest)—the bigger and stronger you are, the more inventory slots you have. As your size increases, so too does your bulk—a larger creature takes more effort to carry. Your bulk equals the larger of either a) your minimum bulk or b) the total bulk of everything in your inventory.\n\n`\n  Creature Size    Inventory Slots    Minimum Bulk  \n ---------------- ------------------ -------------- \n  Tiny             6 + STR                       5  \n  Small            14 + STR                     10  \n  Medium           18 + STR                     20  \n  Large            22 + (STR x 2)               40  \n  Huge             30 + (STR x 4)               80  \n  Gargantuan       46 + (STR x 8)              160  \n`\nAn example\n```Here we see three characters calculate their inventory:\nValiant, a human cleric, is a medium-sized creature (18 slots) with +2 STR (+2 slots). He has a total of 20 inventory slots, and occupies a minimum of 20 slots when carried.\nCrackle, a kobold wizard, is a small creature (14 slots) with −1 STR (−1 slot). She has 13 inventory slots and occupies a minimum of 10 slots.\nBrakken, a goliath barbarian, is a medium-sized creature with Powerful Build (22 slots) and +3 STR (+6 slots). She has 28 inventory slots and occupies a minimum of 20 slots when carried.```\n\n***Basic Supplies***\nIn addition to inventory slots, you can freely carry a limited number of basic supplies—one ration box, one waterskin, and one purse.\n\n> **Ration box**: Stores up to five basic food rations.\n> **Waterskin**: Holds enough liquid for five drink rations.\n> **Purse**: Holds up to 100 assorted coins.\n\nThese three basic supply containers don't occupy any inventory slots, but they can still be affected by NPCs and monsters in some fashion—stolen, damaged, destroyed, etc—so keep an eye on them.\n**Additional Supplies**: You can carry additional supplies (more rations, waterskins, purses, etc) by adding them into your inventory space as normal.\n\n***Carrying Objects***\nWhen you hold or carry an object, you add it to your inventory. Fill a number of inventory slots according to the object's bulk—the bulkier the object, the more inventory slots you must fill.\nExample\n```Valiant buys some hempen rope (2 bulk) and a torch (1 bulk) and puts them in his backpack, filling 3 slots.\nLater, when Crackle is knocked unconscious by a rock trap, Valiant carries her to safety. As a small creature (10 bulk), she occupies 10 inventory slots.```\n\nUse `!nr bulk` for estimating bulk\nUse `!nr inventory2` or `!nr inv2` for second page of inventory rules."

inv2 = "__**Inventory management 2**__\n\n***Encumbrance***\nIf you find yourself carrying more than your inventory capacity allows, you are encumbered. While you are encumbered, you gain the following condition:\n**Encumbered**: \n> Your speed is halved.\n> You have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\n\n**Maximum Capacity**\nYou can't exceed your inventory capacity by more than half your maximum inventory slots (rounded down).\n\nExample: \n```Valiant has an inventory capacity of 20 slots. He is encumbered from 21 slots, and can't carry more than 30 bulk in total.```\n\n***Dragging Objects***\nWhen you drag or pull an object, that object can still affect your inventory. Halve the bulk value of any object that you are dragging or pulling (rounding down).\n**Heaped Objects**: If you're pulling a pile of objects, halve the total amount of bulk—not the individual items.\n**Rolling Transport**: If you're pulling an object that is designed to travel easily (a cart, a wagon, a sled), you may quarter that object's bulk value.\n\nExample:\n```Krazak finds a rotting chest that holds 1,900 assorted copper coins (19 bulk carried, 9 bulk when dragged). He drags the chest back up to the surface and loads it onto a hand cart (20 bulk carried, 5 bulk when pulled).```\n\n***Wearables***\nWearable items—clothes, gloves, boots, hats, necklaces, etc—can be categorized into two groups: *attire *and *armor*.\n> **Attire**: Clothing and finery (necklaces, rings, bracelets, etc) don't occupy any inventory slots while worn— unless that attire is awkward  for you.\n> **Armor**: Armor—and other awkward wearables— continue to occupy inventory slots while worn.\n\nExample:\n```Valiant can carry 20 slots-worth of equipment. Before heading out into adventure, he dons a set of common clothes (attire, 1 bulk) and some chainmail (armor, 9 bulk)—he has 11 slots left for other equipment.\nCrackle, meanwhile, is trying to infiltrate a draconic cult. She has fashioned a dragon costume (attire, 2 bulk) that is awkward to move around in—it continues to fill 2 inventory slots even when worn.```\n\n***Armor Expertise***\nArmor is big and bulky, but there's a trade-off—you become more resistant to harm.\nIf you're wearing medium or heavy armor (and you're appropriately proficient) you gain one of the following perks. These doesn't stack with any additional armor feats or bonuses you might gain—use the highest value.\n> **Medium Armor**: Reduce any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from non-magical weapons by half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), to a minimum of 1.\n> **Heavy Armor**: Reduce any bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take from non-magical weapons by your proficiency bonus, to a minimum of 1.\n\nUse `!nr inventory3` or `!nr inv3` to continue to the 3rd page of the inventory rules."

inv3 = "__**Inventory management**__\nThis is the 3rd page of the inventory management rules.\n\n***Transporting Goods***\nOn your travels, you may need to transport goods in large quantities—carting gold from a dragon's lair, shipping ore across the sea, moving grain from one village to another.\nFor this, you'll need transport vehicles and containers.\n\nVehicles—carts, carriages, ships, trains, etc—store items in the same way as characters: with inventory slots.\nVehicle capacity is measured in six scales of spacing— this describes the number of inventory slots available to carry creatures and cargo.\n\n`Vehicle Capacity\n  Spacing                 Examples                 Slots   \n ----------- ------------------------------------ -------- \n  Cramped      Cart (Hand), Sled (Hand)                20  \n  Snug         Cart (Horse), Chariot, Rowboat          60  \n  Compact      Wagon, Carriage (Horse), Keelboat      180  \n  Spacious     Carriage (Train)                       540  \n  Capacious    Longship, Sailing Ship               1,620  \n  Vast         Galley, Warship                      4,860  \n`\nExample:\n```Valiant, Crackle, and Krazak need to cross the Brindle River. Together, they occupy a total of 50 bulk—they hire a snug rowboat, safe in the knowledge that it can carry all three of them and (probably) won't sink```\n\n**Transport Animals**\nCreatures can also carry items for you—pack mules, horses, elephants, etc. The carrying capacity of these creatures depends on their size category and strength modifier (or con if its higher)—the same as any character.\n\n***Storage Containers***\nYou may need to transport goods within storage containers—chests, crates, barrels, etc—for security or convenience. A storage container has a number of\ninventory slots equal to its bulk rating:\n> A small chest (1 bulk) has 1 inventory slot.\n> A large crate (3 bulk) has 3 inventory slots.\n> An extra-large barrel (6 bulk) has 6 inventory slots.\n\n**Nested Containers**\nYou can store containers within containers—but a nested container must be at least one size category smaller than its parent.\nExample:\n```Crackle has three containers—two small (1 bulk) chests and one large (3 bulk) crate.\nShe can't fit a 1 bulk chest inside another 1 bulk chest, but she can put both chests inside the crate```\n\n***Magical Containers***\nOn your adventures, you may find magical containers that can change their storage capacity far beyond the normal.\nFor example:\n> **Bag of Holding**: This magical bag (1 bulk) can hold many more items than its size would suggest. A Bag of Holding has 6 inventory slots.\n> **Portable Hole**: This magical object (1 bulk) can be folded out into a container with 9 inventory slots.\n> **Handy Haversack**: This magical haversack (2 bulk) has 12 inventory slots.\nExample:\n```In the ruins of the Arcane Sanctum, Valiant finds a Bag of Holding—still intact after all these years.

inv4 = "**__Inventory management__**\nThis is the 4rth page of inventory managment rules.\n\n***Character Containers***\nCharacters divide their inventory slots into distinct containers—bags, belts, sheathes, etc—that they name, categorize, and place about their person.\n\nExample:\n```Valiant has 11 free inventory slots (with 9 slots already\noccupied by his chain mail). He divides these into:\na 4-slot weapon sheath (for his war pick and shield)\na 3-slot belt (for his healer's kit and torch)\na 4-slot bag (for his prayer book and bedroll).```\n\n**Container Categories**\nContainers can be broadly separated into 5 categories. \nWhen you create your inventory containers, assign a category to each—you can mix and match categories however you like, or even rename them to something more fitting (purse, bandolier, backpack, etc).\nSome containers can only hold items of a particular size, or require more time to retrieve an item—so pick the right containers to suit your needs.\n\n> **Bag**: A bag holds items of any size. You can draw an item from a bag with a full action.\n> **Belt**: A belt can hold only small and tiny items. You can draw an item from a belt with a free action.\n> **Sheath**: A sheath holds weapons and shields. You can draw an item from a sheath with a free action.\n> **Quiver**: A quiver stores bows, crossbows, arrows, quarrels, and javelins. You can draw an item from a quiver with a free action.\n> **Worn**: Space reserved for significant wearables, such as armor and awkward attire.\n\nExample\n```Krazak wants rapid access to his weapons—he puts them in a sheath so he can draw them as a free action.\nHis downtime equipment—cooking tools, gaming sets, whetstones, etc—is unlikely to be needed at sudden notice, and can be stashed away in a bag.```\n\n**Changing Containers**\nCharacters can change their containers for free during a long rest, providing they have access to basic supplies and commodities via a village, town, or city.\n\nExample\n```While in town, Valiant swaps out a 6-slot bag for a 4-slot bag and 2-slot belt to hold his healing potions```\n\n**Container Example**\n\nChansi, a halfing ranger with −1 STR, can have only 13 inventory slots due to her small size and strength—humans have it so easy. She has 120 gp.\nSome decent leather armor is a must when ranging through the wild forests—animals have sharp claws. Chansi favors the trap and shortbow, but carries a sword and dagger for times when her prey gets too close.\nThe armor was costly, but it's saved Chansi's life on more than one occasion—well worth the price, and there's plenty of work for a talented ranger nowadays anyway.\n\nQuiver (3/3)\n> Shortbow (25 gp, 2 slot)\n> Arrows (1 gp, 1 slot)\n\nSheath (3/3)\n> Shortsword (10 gp, 2 bulk)\n> Dagger (2 gp, 1 bulk)\n\nBag (4/4)\n> Hunting Trap (5 gp, 2 bulk)\n> Rope (1 gp, 2 bulk)\n\nWorn (3)\n> Studded Leather (45 gp, 3 bulk)\n\nRation Box: Basic Ration (5)\nWaterskin: Clean Water (5)\nPurse: 31 gp (31 coins)\n\nVikan, a goliath sorcerer with +2 STR, can have up to 26 inventory slots thanks to his Powerful Build—he might smash his head on a few ceilings, but being big does have its advantages. He has 60 gp.\nAs a sorcerer, Vikan eschews armor—it gets in the way of his raw arcane energies. He carries a quarterstaff for some basic defense and a crossbow for hunting.\nA keen painter, Vikan carries painting supplies with him to capture inspirational scenes out in the wild. His art isn't going to win any awards, but Vikan paints for the love of the craft and not the reward.\n\nSheath (3/3)\n> Quarterstaff (2 sp, 3 bulk)\n\nQuiver (3/3)\n> Light Crossbow (25 gp, 2 bulk)\n> Bolts (1 gp, 1 slot)\n\nBelt (4/6)\n> Focus, Orb (20 gp, 1 bulk)\n> Gaming Set, Cards (5 sp, 1 bulk)\n> Lamp (5 sp, 1 bulk)\n> Oil (1 sp, 1 bulk)\n\nBag (5/14)\n> Painter's Supplies (10 gp, 2 bulk)\n> Blanket (5 sp, 1 bulk)\n> Bedroll (1 gp, 2 bulk)\n> Rope, Hempen (1 gp, 2 bulk)\n\nRation box: Basic ration (5)\nWaterskin: Clean water (5)\nPurse:  8 sp (8 coins)\n\nUse `!nr inventory5` or `!nr inv5` for the 5th page of inventory management rules."

inv5 = "__**Inventory management**__\nThis is the 5th page of inventory management rules.\n\n**Vehicles and Building Containers**\nYou can also use containers to divide up other forms of inventory—such as vehicle and building storage. Use these to control where items are placed. For example:\n\n```The Amber Jewel, sailing ship of Port Rondel, has a\ntotal of 1,620 inventory slots. These are divided into:\n Crew and Passengers: 810 slots\n Cargo (secure): 405 slots\n Cargo (unsecured): 405 slots\n\nThe spacious Landril Warehouse on the Port's eastern docks can hold up to 540 inventory slots. These are divided into four regions:\n General Cargo: 220 slots\n Frozen Goods: 135 slots\n Secured Cargo: 135 slots\n Vaulted Goods: 50 slots```\n\n***Object Scaling***\nThe bulk ratings listed in the equipment tables assume the perspective of a medium-sized character for simplicity.\nBut if you want to scale object sizes up or down, apply the following bulk category modifiers when appropriate.\n**Creature Sizing**: A creature can't use an object that's inappropriate for their size (either too small or too large).\n\n`Scaling Modifiers\n    Scale               Description              Bulk Category  \n ------------ --------------------------------- --------------- \n  Tiny         Much smaller than normal.          −2            \n  Small         Smaller than normal.              −1            \n  Large         Larger than normal.               +1            \n  Huge          Much larger than normal.          +2            \n  Gargantuan    Much, much larger than normal.    +3            \n`\nExample\n```Krazak encounters an ogre with a greatclub. Normally, a greatclub is a 3 bulk weapon—but this one is larger than normal and so is 6 bulk (+1 bulk category).```\n\n**Armor Sizes**\nTo scale armor with creature size ratings, use these alternate bulk ratings instead.\n`\n     Size      Light    Medium    Heavy    Shield  \n ------------ -------- -------- -------- --------- \n  Tiny              1        2        3         1  \n  Small             2        5        7         1  \n  Medium            3        6        9         2  \n  Large             4        7       11         3  \n  Huge              5       10       15         4  \n  Gargantuan        8       15       23         5  \n\n`\nExample\n```Chansi wants to buy some light armor. Because she is a halfling, her small-sized light armor is only 2 bulk.\n\nViridian also buys some light armor. As a tiefling, his medium-sized light armor is 3 bulk.```"

bulk = "__**Bulk estimation**__\nThis page shows how to estimate bulk for objects.\n\n**Estimating Bulk**\nTo choose a bulk rating for an object, consider its general size, weight, and shape—the more uncomfortable an item is to hold, the higher the bulk rating. \n**Extremely Small Objects**: Some items are especially small and easy to pack together—pins, coins, paperclips, etc. It takes 100 of these items to fill one inventory slot.\n**Extremely Large Objects**: If you need to assign a bulk rating to an extremely large object, use a multiple of 18 for your bulk rating—18/36/54/72, etc.\n\n**Category**: Tiny\n**Bulk**: 0.2 \n**Size**: Tiny: Smaller than the palm of your hand. You can hold many of these in one hand.\n**Weight**: Negligible: A negligible or trivial weight.\n\n**Category**: Small \n**Bulk**: 1 \n**Size**: Short: Up to a handspan / 9 inches. Can be held comfortably with one hand.\n**Weight**: Light: Up to 2 lbs. The weight of a loaf of bread or a bag of sugar.\n\n**Category**: Medium \n**Bulk**: 2 \n**Size**:Medium: Up to an arms-length / 2 feet long. Can be held with one hand.\n**Weight**: Medium: Up to 5 lbs. About as heavy as a few big bags of sugar.\n\n**Category**: Large \n**Bulk**: 3 \n**Size**: Long: Longer than an arm. Usually can be held with one hand, but is most comfortable with two.\n**Weight**: Heavy: Up to 10 lbs. About as heavy as a cat or a sack of potatoes.\n\n**Category**: X-Large \n**Bulk**: 6 \n**Size**: Extra-long: Longer than the height of an average person. Requires two hands to hold.\n**Weight**: Extra-heavy: Up to 35 lbs. About a quarter of the weight of an average person.\n\n**Category**: XX-Large \n**Bulk**: 9 \n**Size**: Extensive: Longer than the height of two people. Requires two hands to hold.\n**Weight**: Leaden: Up to 70 lbs. About half as heavy as an average person."

durMenu = "__**Durability**__\n\nItems degrade with use, losing condition until they become useless. This is measured with notches—the more notches an item has, the more it has degraded.\nItems gain notches through damage, consequences, and critical failures, and must be repaired or otherwise restored using the correct skills, tools, and expertise to function properly again.\nMenu\n `!nr durability` or `!nr dur`\n> Damaging items\n> Shattered items\n`!nr durability2` or `!nr dur2`\n> Reparing items\n> Tempering items"

dur = "__**Durability**__\nThis is the 1st page of Durability rules.\n\n***Damaging Items***\nAny object that can suffer damage can become notched, reducing its functionality and quality—through scratches, chips, dents, and cracks.\nObjects generally fall into one of four categories:\nweapons, armor, magic foci, and miscellaneous items.\n\n**Armor**:\n> If you are critically hit by an attack, your armor gains a notch of damage. Each notch reduces your total AC by 1.\n> **Unarmored**: If you're not wearing any armor and are critically hit by an attack, select a random item in your inventory—that item gains a new notch instead\n\n**Weapons**:\n> Weapons—both melee and ranged—gain a notch when you critically fail an attack (or other relevant action) with them.\n> Each weapon notch reduces by one step the damage die you roll with that weapon (to a minimum of 1).\n> **Multiple Dice**: Some weapons roll multiple die for their damage (greatswords, for example, rolling 2d6). In these cases, one notch reduces the size of the largest die by one size category (see Type B below).\n> **Sustained Damage**: A weapon's damage can't go below 1, but it can still gain additional notches. These notches must be repaired with relevant tools (whetstones, smith's tools, etc) to restore the weapon's damage dice\n> `Weapon Damage Degradation\n> Type A: 1d12 → 1d10 → 1d8 → 1d6 → 1d4 → 1\n> Type B: 2d6 → 1d6 + 1d4 → 2d4 → 1d4 + 1 → 2 → 1`\n\n**Spellcasting Focus**\n> A spellcasting focus (a bard's instrument, a wizard's staff, a cleric's holy symbol, etc) gains a notch whenever you critically fail a spellcasting action whilst holding it.\n> Each notch reduces your total spellcasting ability by 1 for any action which involves that focus.\n> Magical Mishaps: If you roll a critical fail while spellcasting and are not holding a spellcasting focus at the time, the power strikes out and hits a random item in your inventory—that item gains a notch of damage.\n\n**Miscellaneous items**\n> All other items gain a notch whenever appropriate—often when they take direct damage or are used in a failed skill check (such as rolling a natural 1 to disarm a trap with a set of thieves tools).\n> Each notch reduces the item's efficacy by 1, adding a cumulative −1 penalty to any roll made using that item.\n> Using a lockpick with one notch, for example, will apply a −1 penalty to your lockpicking attempts.\n\nExample:\n```GM: The door to the basement is locked, Viridian. A heart is etched under the key hole.\nViridian: Locked? Against a bard and his lock picks? I don't think so... (rolls 1) ...oh come on!\nGM: You feel one of the tools bend awkwardly in your hand. Your lockpicks take a notch of damage.```\n\n***Shattered Gear***\n\nIf your items suffer too much damage, they can break irreparably into useless scrap.\nObjects are grouped into three categories of toughness based on their overall construction: delicate, sturdy, and indestructible. Most objects are sturdy enough to withstand a fair amount of punishment (up to 10 notches), but delicate items can shatter after just two notches.\n> **Fragility**: Delicate\n> **Description**: Thin glass, ceramics, complicated or tiny machinery\n> **Max Notches**: 1\n\n> **Fragility**: Sturdy\n> **Description**: Wood, metal, well-made goods\n> **Max Notches**: 10\n\n> **Fragility**: Indestructible\n> **Description**: Thick stone, strong metals\n> **Max Notches**: 100+\n\n**Sacrificing Weapons and Armor**\nWhen you hit a target with an attack, you can choose to sacrifice your weapon to roll its original un-notched damage die. Decide this before you roll your damage.\nLikewise, when you are hit by an attack you can choose to sacrifice your armor and reduce the damage taken by 3d4 for light armor, 3d8 for medium armor, and 3d12 for heavy armor. You can decide this after damage is dealt.\n**Irreparably Destroyed**: When you sacrifice a weapon or armor in this way, it is irreparably destroyed—you can't repair it nor restore the item with simple magic (such as the Mending cantrip)."

dur2 = "__**Durability**__\nThis is the 2nd page of the durability rules.\n\n***Repairing Items***\nItems can be repaired by an appropriate craftsman, costing 10% of the item price per notch. Depending on the item, this may require rare or expensive components.\nCharacters can also perform basic repairs on their gear with relevant tools—a whetstone to smooth out a notch, a sewing kit to patch up a robe, a hammer to tap out a dent, etc. \nTo repair one notch, you must spend one hour using a set of tools and make an Intelligence (Tool) ability check. If you succeed, you repair one notch of damage. If you critically fail, however, you create a new notch.\n**Repair DC**: The GM will decide the DC of your repair based on the relative ability of your tools and the overall state (or rarity) of your item: very easy (5), easy (10), medium (15), hard (20), very hard (25), or impossible (30).\n\n**Mending**\nThe Mending cantrip repairs broken items—a broken key, a punctured waterskin, a split bow, a torn page, etc.\nNotches, however, represent only minor or superficial damage to an item—not a complete break—and can't be removed with Mending.\nYou can, however, use Mending to restore an item that has shattered from too many notches. A restored item is usable again, but has the maximum number of notches— without repairs, it will break again with one more notch.\n\n__**Tempering Gear**__\n\nWith the right skills and the right materials, you can make your gear more resistant to wear and tear. This is called tempering and it reduces the number of notches your equipment takes from critical failures.\n\n**Temper Qualities**\nWhen you temper an item, you strengthen the material so that it can withstand more punishment and remain effective for longer—a tempered sword becomes harder to chip, and tempered armor harder to crack. The better the temper, the stronger your equipment.\nThere are three grades of temper, each more exclusive and expensive than the last: pure, royal, and astral.\n\n`Tempering gear\n     Quality        Rarity       Critical Failure     \n ---------------- ----------- ----------------------- \n  —                Common      Gains 1 notch          \n  Pure Temper      Uncommon    Gains ½ (0.5) notch    \n  Royal Temper     Rare        Gains ¼ (0.25) notch   \n  Astral Temper    Mythic      Gains ⅛ (0.125) notch  \n`\n\n**Tempered Protection**\nA tempered piece of equipment is less vulnerable to the effects of wear and tear. When you would gain 1 notch from a critical failure (such as when attacking or\ndefending), you instead gain only a fraction of a notch—a half, a quarter, or an eighth, depending on the quality.\n\n***Applying a Temper***\n\nTo temper a piece of equipment, you need four things:\ntime, facilities, materials, and skill. You won't usually be able to temper gear yourself—such work requires special training—so keep an eye out for trained craftsmen.\n\n`Tempering Costs\n  Quality         Cost          Time      Tempered Value   \n ---------- ----------------- ---------- ----------------- \n  Pure       Base value × 2    3 days     Base value × 3   \n  Royal      Base value × 4    1 week     Base value × 6   \n  Astral     Base value × 8    2 weeks    Base value × 12  \n`\n**Craftsmen**\nIt's relatively straightforward to find someone who can apply a pure temper—for a price, of course. However, royal and astral tempering is extremely rare—you'll need to search far and wide for such legendary craftsmen.\n\n**Rare Materials**\nEspecially rare and unique equipment may require special materials for tempering—ore from ancient mines, red dragon scales, a gem from a slaad's brain, etc. Recovering these components may be an adventure in itself.\n\n***Repairing Tempered Gear***\nWhen you temper an item, its inherent value increases (as shown in the Tempered Value column of the Tempering Costs table above). This also means that it becomes more expensive to repair notches on your tempered item—so make sure you have enough coin to look after your gear."

ammo = "__**Ammunition**__\n\n***Ammunition Die***\nInstead of tracking each individual shot, take a d12—this is your Ammunition die. Roll it whenever you take a shot: if\nyou roll a 1 or 2, the die gets one size smaller.\nIf you're down to one piece of ammunition and you use it, that's it—it's all gone! Remove it from your inventory.\nAmmunition Die\n> d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4 → 1\n\nExample:\n```GM: The ghoul grabs hold of you tight, Viridian, moaning as it prepares to bite. What do you do?\nViridian: Uh Chansi, need a little help here!\nChansi: Yea see the thing is, I'm kinda running low on arrows. Ammunition die is down to a d4—\nViridian: TAKE THE DAMN SHOT, CHANSI!\nChansi: Fine. That's... (rolls 15) ...15 to hit, and... (rolls 1) ...damn, a 1 for ammunition. Last arrow.```\n\nSpecial ammo\n> If your ammunition is rare or has limited uses—fire arrows, magic bolts, lighting bullets, etc—don't use an ammunition die. Track each individual shot as you use them.\n\n\n\nDie size: d20 Remaining uses: 30\nDie size: d12 Remaining uses: 20\nDie size: d10 Remaining uses: 14\nDie size: d8 Remaining uses: 9\nDie size: d6 Remaining uses: 5\nDie size: d4 Remaining uses: 2\n\n**Ammunition stacks**\nMost ammunition types will start with (and have a maximum size of) a d12 ammunition die—this represents a\nfull stack of arrows/bolts/bullets/etc. Some special items, however, may have their own unique limitations—such as a\nwand with d8 maximum charges.\nMultiple Stacks: If you're carrying multiple stacks of any one type of ammunition, prioritize the smallest stack.\nAlways roll the smallest ammunition die per ammo type.\n\n**Replenishing Ammunition**\nTo increase your ammunition die you can recover ammo from the environment, buy a new stack, or pay a small\npercentage of the total cost to increase your die by one step based on the maximum die size for that ammo type\nTo replenish a stack of arrows (max size d12) from d8 to d10 would cost 20 cp (20% of 1 gp).\n> d20 16%\n> d12 20%\n> d10 25%\n> d8 33%\n> d6 50%\n> d4 100%"

xp = "__**Experience**__\nYou don't gain experience for simply killing monsters—instead, you gain experience by being active in one of three fields of adventure: discovery, recovery, and adversity.\n> **Discovery**: Explore the world, meet new people, and uncover secrets—hidden dungeons, ancient cults, legendary monsters. The more valuable and rare your discovery, the more experience you gain.\n> **Recovery**: Recover treasure and valuables from uncivilized, monstrous, or abandoned areas—gemstones from an ancient tomb, a dragon's hoard, a hidden chest of jewels.\n> You gain 10 XP per gold piece (1 XP per silver piece) of recovered treasure, making this the most efficient means of gaining experience.\n> **Adversity**: Face danger and survive perilous situations— recover from near death, challenge a red dragon, defeat a horde of orcs. The bigger the danger, the bigger your experience—if you can survive.\n\nLeave your comfort zone behind, go adventuring in the dangerous wilds, and get into trouble—take risks, overcome challenges, and reap the rewards.\n\n***Advancement***\nDon't use the standard 5e leveling table for experience — instead, use the Character Advancement table listed below.\nThis demonstrates the amount of experience a character needs to spend per level in order to level up.\n\n`\n  Level    XP Needed  \n -------- ----------- \n  0-1            150  \n  1-2            300  \n  2-3            420  \n  3-4            590  \n  4-5            820  \n  5-6          1,150  \n  6-7          1,610  \n  7-8          2,260  \n  8-9          3,160  \n  9-10         4,430  \n  10-11        6,200  \n  11-12        8,680  \n  12-13       12,150  \n  13-14       17,010  \n  14-15       23,810  \n  15-16       33,330  \n  16-17       46,660  \n  17-18       65,330  \n  18-19       91,460  \n  19-20      128,050  \n`\n\n**Spending Experience**\nWhen you gain XP, you can spend it to level up.

It's hard to shape, it's too chaotic, it's too powerful—whatever the\nreason, some magic energy lashes out during your spellcasting attempt and causes you some harm.\nThis is called burnout and it can happen to any caster, whether arcane or divine. Magic is dangerous work, and\nthe slightest distraction can be catastrophic.\n\n**Triggering Burnout**\nIf you are a spellcaster, take a d12 for full caster, d10 for half caster or d8 for third caster—this is your Burnout die.\nNote that for the purposes of spellcasting ranks and burnout, warlocks count as a full caster. \nIf you are multiclassed, use the maximum burnout die of whichever caster class you have the most levels in.

journey = "# __***Travel Phase Rules***__\nKeep in mind that Travel Phase is for late game. So dont worry about these rules until you have explored a few regions first.\n\nIf you wish to make a long journey, there are three basic steps to follow: plan your route and gather supplies, travel the distance, and arrive at your destination.\n\n1) Plan Your Route\n- The first step in making a long journey is planning—you need to decide where you're going, how you're getting there, and who you're travelling with.\n - Pick the destination: First, pick your destination. This could be a dungeon, city, or other landmark.\n - Choose your route: Next, you need to decide which route you'll take. The length of your route is measured not in miles but in days (assuming an average walking speed of 15 miles per day)\n - Gather supplies: Finally, gather any supplies, vehicles, and equipment needed for the journey.\n\n2) Travel\nNow it's time to gather everyone and head out on your journey. The average day is broken up into six parts—dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, dusk, and night—so run through these in sequence for each day of travel.\n- **Dawn**: Sunlight crests the horizon. It's time to wake up, eat some breakfast,  and pack up camp.\n - Check the weather: The weather can have a drastic impact on your  travel plans—especially if you're not properly prepared. You may want to avoid travel completely during heavy rains, storms, and snows.\n - Assign roles: Decide who is going to be today's Guide :compass:, Forager :basket:, Scout :detective: and Lookout :eye:. A character can only assume one role at a time, so pick wisely.\n - Set pace: Decide what pace you'll be travelling at today—slow,  medium, or fast. A slower pace makes it easier to succeed at your roles, but also means that the journey takes longer to complete.\n - Eat breakfast: Eat some food and drink some water to build up your energy for the travel ahead.\n - Pack up camp: Put out any cooking fires, strap on your gear, and pack up your camp.\n- **Morning.**: The sun rises and the day becomes warmer. Begin the first half of today's travelling.\n- **Noon**: The sun is at its peak. Take a short break, sit in the shade, and rest your feet.\n- **Afternoon**: The sun descends and the temperature cools. Press on to finish the second half of today's travel while you still have some natural light.\n- **Dusk**: The sun sinks beneath the horizon and the sky darkens. It's time to set up camp for the night, eat a good meal, and reflect on today's travel.\n - Make camp: Take off your gear and set up camp.\n - Lookout duty: The lookout takes charge of camp defense and security for the night. While on lookout, a character can only eat and sleep—they don't have time to do or join in with anything else.\n - Guide: The guide makes a guidance check to confirm the adventuring party's location—did you all stay on track, or have you veered off in the wrong direction?\n - Forage: The forager makes a foraging check to see if they were able to gather any food or water supplies throughout the day's travel.\n - Eat dinner: Eat some food and drink some water to help recover from the day's travel.\n- **Night** The night is dark and full of terrors—an unwelcoming time for travelers out in the wilds. Travel is very difficult and it's very easy to get lost in the dark, so best get some sleep and recover your energy for tomorrow.\n\n3) Arrive\n- After enough days of travel have passed—if you didn't lose your way—you'll arrive at your destination."

lightMenu = "__**Light And Shadow**__\nDanger hides in darkness. a monster, lurking in the night, pounces as you stumble in the dark. A trap, hidden in the gloom of an unlit dungeon, clicks underfoot ominously. A way out of a deadly maze goes unseen in shadow. A seasoned adventurer soon learns not to travel without a set of dry torches—or a precious lantern—close to hand. These rules introduce light levels to help track light more easily.\n\n**Menu**\n>`!nr light`\n> Types of Vision\n> Light levels\n\n`!nr light2`\n> Common Light equipment\n\n`!nr light3`\n> Light spell changes\n> Room scales\n\n **Lighting Level Conditions**\n```Light is Darkest\nYou have Brightvision > Blinded\nYou have Low-light Vision > Blinded\nYou have Darkvision > Blinded\n\nLight is Dark\nYou have Brightvision > Blinded\nYou have Low-light Vision > Blinded\nYou have Darkvision > Partially Blinded\n\nLight is Dim\nYou have Brightvision > Partially Blinded\nYou have Low-light Vision > No Penalty\nYou have Darkvision > No Penalty\n\nLight is Bright\nYou have Brightvision > No Penalty\nYou have Low-light Vision > No Penalty\nYou have Darkvision >No Penalty\n\nLight is Brightest\nYou have Brightvision > No Penalty\nYou have Low-light Vision > Partially Blinded\nYou have Darkvision> Blinded```"

light = "__**Light And Shadow**__\n\n***Types of Vision***\nTo help instill a fear of the dark, it's important that characters don't have easy access to Darkvision. To that\neffect, these rules introduce following changes:\n> **Low-light Vision**: If you have the Darkvision racial trait, replace it with Low-light Vision.\n> **Darkvision**: If you have the Superior Darkvision racial trait, replace it with Darkvision.\n> **Brightvision**: If you have neither low-light vision nor darkvision, you are assumed to have Brightvision.\n\nDarkvision gained from other sources—such as items, spells, effects, etc—remains unchanged.\n\n***Lighting Levels***\nLight can be measured—and described—with five basic categories of increasing intensity: darkest, dark, dim, bright, and brightest.\nWhen players enter a notable region—such as a room, dungeon, or overworld— the DM describes the level of light in their environment. No need to worry too much about precise distances at this point—simply apply the same level of lighting to the entire area of interest for simplicity.\n\n**Light Levels**\n```Level 0: Darkest\n>  No light at all—total darkness, a windowless room, an unlit dungeon.\n\nLevel 1: Dark \n> Very faint light—moonlight and starlight, outdoors at midnight, a small candelabra in a room.\n\nLevel 2: Dim \n> Fading light—thick stormcloud, heavy fog, a room with weak lights.\n\nLevel 3: Bright \n> Clear and visible—a cloudy or overcast day, a room with many lights.\n\nLevel 4: Brightest\n>  Excessive light—clear light all around, a sunny day, a noble's ballroom party.```                                                         \n\n\n\n**Darkest Light**\nIn places where there is no light whatsoever, it is darkest— total darkness, a sealed and windowless room, an unlit underground dungeon, a zone of magical darkness, etc.\nWhile the lighting is darkest, you gain the Blinded condition as described below—even if you have darkvision (there is no light for your eyes to reflect and magnify).\n\n```Blinded\n- You can't see.\n- You automatically fail ability checks that require sight.\n- Attack rolls against you have advantage if your opponent can see you.\n- Your attack rolls have disadvantage.\n- You can't cast spells or use effects that require you to see the target.\n- You can't actively target creatures that have hidden from you (such as with a Hide action).\n- Your speed is halved.\n- You are vulnerable to stress (Check `!nr stressm` for more information on stress)```\n\n**Dark Light**\nIn places where there is a faint glimmer of light, it is dark— a graveyard at midnight, a dungeon with faintly glowing lichen, a room lit by a rusted candelabra.\nWhile the lighting is dark, you are Blinded—unless you have darkvision, in which case you are the Partially Blinded condition instead.\n\n```\nPartially Blinded\nYou have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\n```\n\n**Dim Light**\nIn places where the light is faded or murky, it is dim—a misty forest, the twilight after a setting sun, a volcanic lair with glowing lava, a burning fireplace in a room, etc.\nWhile the lighting is dim, you gain the Partially Blinded condition—unless you have darkvision or low-light vision, in which case you can see normally.\n\n**Bright Light**\nIn places where the light is abundant and visible, it is bright—a clear day, a properly-lit room, a sinister tomb with two huge and flaming braziers.\nWhen the lighting is bright, you can see normally.\n\n**Brightest Light**\nIn places where the light is excessive and practically dazzling, it is brightest—a clear and sunny day, the solar room of a sun god's temple, a dungeon illuminated by a raging, white-hot fire elemental, etc.\nWhen the lighting is brightest, you can see normally.\n**If you have lowlight vision, you gain the Partially Blinded condition—if you have darkvision, you are Blinded instead.**"

light2 = "__**Light And Shadow**__\n\n***Light Sources***\n\nLight sources come in many forms—candles, torches, magical spells, fire  elementals, etc. Each source has a power category to reflect the amount of light it produces— tiny, small, medium, large, huge, and gargantuan.\nTypically, the bigger the source the more light it can put out—though power and intensity are also a factor. Use the Light Sources table below to determine how much light a particular item (or creature) should emit.\n**Total Light:** Once you know the strength of each significant light source in an area, add them to the lighting level to find out just how bright it is.\n\n` Light Sources\n    Power       Light                 Examples               \n ------------- -------- ------------------------------------ \n  Tiny          +0.2     Candle.                             \n  Small         +1       Torch, Lantern (hood down), Flare.  \n  Medium        +2       Lantern (hood up), Fireplace.       \n  Large         +4       Brazier, Glass chandelier.          \n  Huge          +8       Raging fire elemental.              \n  Gargantuan    +16      Burning building                    `\n\n**Common Equipment**\n\nA seasoned adventurer knows that there are three common, everyday ways to create a light in the dark:\ncandles, torches, and lanterns.\nMost of the lighting equipment used by adventurers will fall into one of these three categories—for other bespoke items, use the Light Sources table as a guide.\n\n*Candles*\n> Candles produce very little light on their own, but they are cheap and easy to make. They produce little smoke and so can be used comfortably indoors.\n> This candle emits a tiny (+0.2) amount of light for up to 1 hour. You can snuff out a burning candle with an object interaction—each time it is snuffed out, deduct 15 minutes from the remaining burn time.\n> **Residue**: This common candle produces wax and a noticeable smell as it burns.\n> **Dropped**: If the candle is carelessly dropped, thrown, or knocked over, roll a d6\n> 1-3: The candle breaks and can't be used again.\n> 4-5: The candle is snuffed out.\n> 6: The candle remains lit.\n\n*Torch*\n> Torches produce a small amount of light. Like candles, torches are cheap and relatively easy to make—but they produce a lot of smoke and ash as they burn. Avoid using a torch in an enclosed space whenever possible.\n> This torch emits a small (+1) amount of light for up to 1 hour. You can extinguish a burning torch with a bonus action—each time it is extinguished, deduct 15 minutes from the remaining burn time.\n> You can spend an action to plant a torch in soft ground without extinguishing it.\n> **Residue**: This common torch produces smoke, ash, and a noticeable smell as it burns.\n> **Dropped**: If the torch is carelessly dropped, thrown, or knocked over, roll a d6:\n> 1: The torch breaks and can't be used again.\n> 2-3: The torch is extinguished.\n> 4-6: The torch remains lit.\n\n*Lantern*\n> Lanterns burn brighter than the average torch, and—with the right fuel—for much longer. They produce little smoke and can be used comfortably indoors, but can be very fragile—take care not to drop a lantern.This lantern emits a medium (+2) amount of light for up to 6 hours. You can extinguish a burning lantern with an action —each time it is extinguished, deduct 15 minutes from the remaining burn time.\n> You can spent an action to place a lantern carefully on the ground without extinguishing it.\n> **Fuel**: This common lantern requires oil as fuel.\n> **Hooded**: If your lantern has a hood, you can close it to reduce the light emitted to small (+1) or none (+0).\n> **Dropped**: If the lantern is carelessly dropped, thrown, or knocked over, roll a d6:\n> 1-2: The lantern goes out and loses d3 hours of fuel.\n> 3-4: The lantern is extinguished.\n> 5-6: The lantern remains lit."

In a medium sized room you need +1 light to go from dark to dim light—but in a huge room you need +4 light to make the same change.\n\n`\n  Room Scale    Light needed   Da     D       Di     B       Br   \n  -             per level                                         \n  -----------   ------------   --     ---     ---    ----    --  \n  Tiny          x 0.25         0      0.25    0.5    0.75    1    \n  Small         x 0.5          0      0.5     1      1.5     2    \n  Medium        x 1            0      1       2      3       4    \n  Large         x 2            0      2       4      6       8    \n  Huge          x 4            0      4       8      12      16   \n  Gargantuan    x 8            0      8       16     24      32   `"

wound = "__**Wounds And Injuries**__\n\n***Bloodied***\nA character is considered bloodied when they have lost half of their hit points—when bloodied, they have taken a small cut or bruise. \nSome monsters may react differently to you when you are bloodied—becoming frenzied or blood-thirsty—while others may have an easier time detecting you by scent.\n\n**Healing When Bloodied**\nIf you are bloodied, it's a little harder to recover your stamina. While bloodied, you must use a bandage or other first-aid material in order to spend any hit dice and recover hit points when resting. Make sure to keep an eye on your medical supplies.\n\n***Lingering Wounds***\n\nWhen you fall to 0 hit points, you've taken significant damage and gain an open, lingering wound somewhere on your body. \nRoll on the Lingering Wounds table below to see which part of you was wounded—or pick one based on the type of damage you suffered.\n\n```1 An arm\n2 A leg\n3 A hand\n4 A foot\n5 Your stomach\n6 Your back\n7 Your head\n8 Your face\n9 Your chest\n10 Your buttocks```\n\n**Exhaustion** \nEach time you gain an open wound, you also gain a level of exhaustion. This exhaustion is permanent for as long as your wound is open and untreated. \nYou gain exhaustion for each open wound, so watch out —exhaustion effects stack up fast.\n\n**Treating Wounds**\nA wound hinders you while it's untreated, making your life difficult with exhaustion. You can spend one hour to treat a wound using first-aid knowledge and supplies—make an Intelligence (Medicine) or Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC 10) to patch up the wound. \nA treated wound remains on your character—though it no longer causes exhaustion. A wound will only heal properly during a long rest or with magical healing. \n\nWounds heal naturally over time. At the end of a long rest, roll to see if your wounds have healed—make a Constitution (Medicine) check (DC 15) for each wound. \nSome downtime activities, such as resting, may allow you to roll the check with advantage. \n\n*Magical Healing*\nYou may use magical effects to heal a wound. You do not gain any hit points from the magic in doing this, however— all of the spell's power is used on your wound.\n\n**Reopened Wounds**\nIf you are critically hit during combat, your treated wounds may reopen. When you take critical damage, roll a d20 for each treated wound you have:\n> On a 1: The wound reopens and you lose a hit die \n> On 2-8: The wound reopens \n> On 9-20: The wound remains closed \n\nWhen a wound reopens, it starts applying exhaustion again—you'll need to treat the wound to remove this. \n**Untreated wounds**: Any untreated wound you have fails this check automatically (as if you had rolled a 1), causing you to lose a hit die—so try to keep your wounds bandaged at all times."

woundMenu = "__**Wounds And Injuries**__\n\nAn adventurer without a scar is either very good, very lucky, or very new to the profession—trap ridden dungeons, rabid monsters, and sharp weapons are notoriously bad for your health.

Many, however, die from injury long before retirement.\nThese rules introduce lingering wounds, permanent injuries, and prosthetics.\n\n**Menu**\nUse `!nr wound` for these sections:\n> Bloodied\n> Lingering Wounds\n\nUse `!nr wound2` for these sections\n> Permanent Injuries\n> Prosthetics"

death = "__**Death And Ressurection**__\n\nThere are only two certainties in life: death and taxes. Throughout their career, adventurers face danger and destruction at every turn—and not everyone is lucky enough to make it back to town alive.\nThese rules sets introduce the Dying condition and include rules for persistent death saves, funerals, character wills,\nand resurrection magic.\n\n***Dying***\n\nWhen you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain the Dying condition. You can't move, and your ability to talk is\nlimited. This condition ends if you regain any hit points.\n\nDying Condition\n> You drop whatever you're holding and fall prone.\n> You can't move, take actions, or use reactions.\n> You're aware of what's happening 15 ft around you.\n> You can speak a maximum of two words per round.\n> Attack rolls against you have advantage.\n> You automatically fail STR/DEX saving throws.\n> You must make a death saving throw at the start of your turn. If you fail three death saving throws, you die.\n\n**Death Saving Throws**\nWhile you are dying, you must make a death saving throw at the start of your turn to see how long you can cling onto\nlife—if you fail three death saving throws, you die.\nWhen you make a death saving throw, roll a d20 and check the Death Saving Throw table below to see what\nhappens to you.\n\n1 :  You fail two death saving throws.\n2-9:  You fail one death saving throw.\n10-19:  No change.\n20:  You regain 1 hit point and the dying condition ends.\n\n*Persistent Saves*\nDeath saving throws don't reset after a short rest—instead, you recover one failed death saving throw after completing a long rest. Take care to rest properly.\n\n**Taking Damage**\nIf you are hit by any damaging attack whilst dying, you automatically fail one death saving throw. Critical damage,\nlikewise, causes you to fail one death saving throw.\n\n***Death***\nSometimes, despite your best efforts, your best just isn't good enough—all things come to an end, and your character is unfortunately no exception.\nBut with any luck, you fought a good fight and left the world a little less dark than when you first joined it.\n\n**Your Funeral**\nNo corpse should be left out in the open to be torn apart by birds and wild dogs—a hero deserves a hero's send-off.\nIf explorers are able to recover your body, bury it, and throw an appropriately lavish funeral, they may buy a share of the unspent experience you had when\nyou died—10 XP per gold spent on your funeral.\n\n**Reading Of The Will**\nYou can leave a will behind to confirm who the heirs to your property are. This can be arranged in retrospect with your GM after the character's death if necessary. The reading of the will usually takes place at your funeral, or before the introduction of a new character.\nThis might be the last opportunity for your character to say any final words, so make the most of it.\n\n**A New Beggining and Tiers Of Play**\nOnce you've added your character's name to the graveyard, it's time to start anew with a fresh character.\n\n*Starting Level*\nThere are four tiers that players can attain. The first includes characters of levels 1-4. The second, characters of levels 5-10. The third, 11-16, and the fourth, 17-20. When a character dies, their player’s next character begins at the bottom of the dead character’s tier; for example, Robin’s character, Alphaeus, dies at level 3. Robin’s new character, Belisaria, begins at level 1. Once Belisaria makes it to level 5, any character that Robin plays (for example, Corcoran) would begin at level 5, in the event that Belisaria dies.\n\n*Starting Wealth*\n**Inheritance**: Inherit gold and starting items that were left in Nexus from your old character."

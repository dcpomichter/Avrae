lookout_activity = "**The Lookout**\nIt's a big risk to set up camp without appointing someone to watch out for any would-be intruders. A lookout is in charge of camp security and keeps an eye out for potential threats.\nIf you are the lookout, roll an Intelligence (Survival) check to see how well you secure the camp against potential dangers. If you have any tools, equipment, or magic that might help—traps, bells, the Alarm spell—you may roll your check with advantage.\nSuccess: You noted some weak spots in the camp's defense and secured them. Everyone Heals a minor amount of Stress.\nFailure: You made a bad job of securing the camp. You have disadvantage on perception checks against any would-be intruders while camping. Everyone gains a minor amount of Stress.\n\nBeing on lookout takes a good deal of focus. If you are on lookout, you can't join in with any camp activities besides eating, drinking, and sleeping."

foraging_activity = "**Forage**. \n When spending lengths of time in the wilderness, explorers often prefer to forage and hunt for their food, rather than lug around rations. Over the course of a watch, a character can forage for food or water; if the party is exploring, this can only be done while exploring at a slow or normal pace. At the conclusion of watch, the character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check, with the DC determined by the region the party is travelling through. \n  If the party travelled through more than one region over the course of a watch, use the DC for whichever the party spent the most time in.  \n On a failure, the character finds nothing.  \n On a success, the character finds 1d4 rations. (either water rations or food rations, their choice).  \n The sources of food and water are determined at the GM’s discretion, based on the region the party is travelling through. \n  Most food found is either raw meat from hunted animals that must be cooked, or readily-eaten plant matter, such as nuts and berries. If a character would like to find certain kinds of food only, typically to avoid the need to light a fire, they suffer disadvantage."

crafting_activity = "**Craft An Item** \n You can spend time crafting items if you have the right materials and appropriate crafting tools. Roll the appropriate check for your specific craft. \n Success: You successfully craft your item. You heal a minor amount of stress. \n Failure: You were unable to craft the item. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

materials_activity = "**Gather Materials**\nMany of the Materials can simply be found in the wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to look for and spends the time doing just that. If you travelled at a slow pace through wilderness for 2 watches or more (i.e. not urban land or farmland), you can make a gathering check (Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival skill, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll. The dc is depended on terrain type.) but have  disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.\nIf you dedicate 2 watches to gathering without traveling, you can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item other than an essence of your choice that is available within that biome’s table (making the ability check from the corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any trivial item (making a DC 8 check to harvest it) The found items then have to be gathered. \nRoll a d100 and consult the corresponding table for the relevant biome to determine what is found.\nMaterials are mostly ore, branches, essences, carapaces and scales."

hunting_activity = "**Hunting**\nAfter a region has been surveyed, there may come a time when adventurers would like to hunt down a creature they know dwells in the area, whether to exterminate it, to collect the natural resources its body holds, or perhaps just to talk, for instance.\nA character can only successfully hunt a creature that is known to make its home in the region, whether that knowledge was gained from surveying the region or by other means. Over the course of a watch, a character may attempt to hunt a creature to its lair or other resting spot.\nAt the end of the watch, the character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check against the creatures’ Survey DC. On a success, the character finds the lair, resting place, or home of the hunted creature.\nA character may assist another in hunting, provided they are proficient in Survival.\nCharacters may not hunt while travelling, but the watch spent hunting still counts towards overall travel time for the day.\nWhile hunting normally leads to the central lair of a given group of creatures, such as the goblin’s camp or spider-queen’s nest, in the case of highly widespread creatures, such as elk, it leads to only one such lair.\nHunting elk, for example, might lead to one clearing with many sleeping elk, but there will still be other elk in the region. By contrast, hunting down the single pair of wyverns leads to those particular wyverns’ lair, as they are the only in the region."

reagents_activity = "**Gather Reagents** \nMany of the Reagents can simply be found growing in the wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to look for and spends the time doing just that. If you travelled at a slow pace through wilderness for 2 watches or more (i.e. not urban land or farmland), you can make a gathering check (Wisdom check. If you have a Herbalism kit and are proficient with it, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.  The dc is depended on terrain type.) but have  disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.\nIf you dedicate 2 watches to gathering without traveling, you can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item other than an essence of your choice that is available within that biome’s table (making the ability check from the corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any trivial item (making a DC 8 check to harvest it) The found items then have to be gathered. \nRoll a d100 and consult the corresponding table for the relevant biome to determine what is found.\nReagents are mostly herbs and essences."

survey_activity = "**Surveying**\nWhen in a region of the Wilds, an adventurer can spend time in the wilds, searching for signs of local creatures, so as to ascertain the nature of what dwells in the region.\nOver the course of a watch, a character may survey an entire region to determine what sorts of creatures dwell there. At the end of the watch, the character makes an Intelligence (Nature) check: they discover evidence of each creatures based on its Survey DC.\nAnother character can assist in surveying, provided they are proficient in the Nature skill.\nCharacters may not survey while exploring, but a watch spent surveying still counts toward overall exploring time for the day.\n\n> Survey DC\n> The Survey DC reflects the overall difficulty of finding evidence of a creature in a given region. When a character succeeds to survey, it doesn’t mean that they have specifically found that creature, merely that they have found evidence that the creature lives in that region.\n> While there may be specific subsets of creatures within a given group, such as a Hobgoblin Captain leading a group of Hobgoblins, the Survey DC reflects the group as a whole, and as such should use the stat block of the most common monster in the group."

cooking_activity = "**Cooking**\nIf you know how to cook and have the right supplies, you can prepare a meal for the group. This requires use of a campfire and cooking tools. Expend one use of your cooking supplies to attempt one of the following actions.\n\n> **Create rations**: You slow-cook and preserve some fresh ingredients—usually meat or grains—to create 1d4 + 1 new, basic food rations that can be preserved.\n> **Stretch rations**: You thin out some basic rations into a simple meal, feeding two people for each ration you cook. If cooked successfully, everyone who eats gains 1d4 + 1 hit points (max. once per day).\n> **Cook a hot meal**: You cook a hot meal for everyone, using one ration—or ration substitute—per person. If cooked successfully, everyone who eats the hot meal regains 1 spent hit die (max. once per day) and heals 2 hunger.\n\nBefore you serve the meal, roll a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you prepared everything. Meals spoil after an hour, losing any restorative properties.\nSuccess: The meal is well made. You heal a minor amount of Stress to you and everyone you serve.\nFailure: You spoiled the meal and wasted the ingredients—no one can eat your cooking. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

brewing_activity = "**Brewing**\nIf you know how to brew drinks and have the right supplies, you can prepare some for the group. This requires a campfire and brewer's kit. Expend one use of\nyour brewing supplies to try one of the following actions:\n\n> **Create rations**: You distill some impure water overnight to create 1d4 + 1 new, drinkable rations.\n> **Brew a balm**: With a few herbs you turn some basic water rations into a delicious, soothing drink—one ration per two drinks. Everyone who drinks a fresh balm gains 1d4 + 1 hit points (max. once per day).\n> **Brew a restorative**: You turn some basic water rations into a tasty, hot drink using one ration per drink. Everyone who drinks a fresh restorative regains 1 spent hit die (max. once per day) and heals 2 thirst.\n\nBefore you serve the drinks, roll a Wisdom (Survival) check to see how well you prepared everything. Your brews lose their restorative properties after an hour.\nSuccess: The drinks are well made. You heal a minor amount of Stress to you and everyone you serve.\nFailure: You spoiled the brew and wasted the ingredients—no one can stomach your drinks. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

story_activity = "**Tell A Story**\nPeople like to hear a good story. If you are proficient in Arcana, History, or Religion—or are carrying an interesting book—you can attempt to tell a captivating story to the group. Roll a Charisma (Performance) check.\nSuccess: Your story is well told and inspires an ally. Choose a party member other than yourself or the lookout —that character gains a point of inspiration.  You heal a minor amount of Stress to you and to everyone that is listening to you perform.\nFailure: You made an embarrassing mistake. You gain a minor amount of Stress"

music_activity = "**Play Music**\nIf you know how to play an instrument, you can attempt to play some music for the group. Roll a Dexterity (Performance) check to see how well you play.\nSuccess: You perform well and inspire one of your allies. Choose a party member other than yourself or the lookout—that character gains a point of inspiration. You heal a minor amount of Stress to you and to everyone that is listening to you perform.\nFailure: You made an embarrassing mistake. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

repair_activity = "**Repair An Item**\nIf you're proficient with certain tools, you may perform basic repairs on damaged equipment—sharpening a blunt sword, sewing up a torn robe, hammering out some dented armor. You can try to remove one notch from an item with a successful Intelligence (Tool) check.\nSuccess: You successfully remove one notch. You heal a minor amount of stress.\nFailure: You were unable to make the repairs. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

relax_activity = "**Relax In Solitude**\nIf you prefer to spend some time alone—reading a book, meditating—you can do so. Roll a Wisdom ability check to see if you are able to unwind.\nSuccess: You feel inspired by your seclusion—gain a point of inspiration. You heal a minor amount of stress.\nFailure: You couldn't relax as something—or someone— was irritating you too much. You gain a minor amount of Stress."

game_activity = "**Play A Game**\nIf you have a gaming set and know the rules, you can play a game to unwind. Anyone can join in—so long as they're not occupied with another activity—but at least one person playing must be proficient in the rules.\nEveryone who plays can roll an Intelligence (Game) ability check—the highest roll wins.\nWinner: You feel inspired—gain a point of inspiration. You heal a moderate amount of Stress.\nLoser: You lost the game. You heal a minor amount.\nTie: You heal a minor amount of Stress."
